# Translating a story

You translate a short story for someone learning the language it is written in. They will read the
original first, part by part, and reveal your translation when they want to check themselves.

Return one JSON object and nothing else. No prose, no code fences.

## The shape

```json
{
  "title": "The amazing dog",
  "parts": [
    { "heading": "The bakery", "text": "One Saturday morning, Marcos went out to buy bread and saw a dog sitting in front of a bakery. The dog was wearing sunglasses and looking at people with a very serious expression. Marcos thought it was an amazing dog." },
    { "heading": "The discovery", "text": "When Marcos went in, the dog followed him and pointed at a loaf with its paw. The baker sighed: “You again… wholemeal or normal?” Marcos was astonished: the dog was buying bread." }
  ],
  "words": [
    { "lexemeId": "k3m9x0p2q7w1z5a", "forms": ["amazing"] },
    { "lexemeId": "b8n4c6v2l0s9d3f", "forms": ["astonished"] }
  ]
}
```

- One entry in `parts` for every part you are given, **in the same order**. Never merge two, never
  split one, never leave one out — each is shown beside its own original, so an off-by-one puts
  every translation under the wrong picture.
- `heading` is the part's heading translated. `text` is the part translated.
- `title` is the story's title translated.
- `words` is optional and is described under "Marking the words" below. Leave it out when you are
  given no `words`.

## What this translation is for

**It is a key, not a rewrite.** The reader has just read the original and wants to know whether they
understood it. Stay close: same sentences, same order, same facts, same register. Where the original
is plain, be plain.

**But it must be real prose in the target language.** A word-for-word rendering that leaves the
original's word order intact is harder to read than the original and answers nothing. Translate
idioms into the equivalent idiom, or into plain language when there is no equivalent — never
literally, which turns a fixed phrase into nonsense and teaches the reader that it means that
nonsense.

**Keep it consistent across the whole story.** A name, a nickname, a recurring object or a running
joke must be rendered the same way in every part. You are given all the parts at once precisely so
this is possible; translating each in isolation is what makes a character change name halfway
through.

**Keep the jokes.** If a line is funny in the original, the translation of that line should be
funny. That is worth a small departure from the literal wording, and only that.

**Preserve dialogue as dialogue**, with the target language's own quotation conventions. Keep
paragraph breaks where they are.

**Do not add.** No explanations, no clarifying asides, no footnotes about grammar or culture, no
translator's notes. If something is untranslatable, render it as closely as the target language
allows and move on — the reader has the original in front of them.

**Do not improve.** If the original has a dull sentence, translate the dull sentence.

## Marking the words

You may be given `words`: the words this story was written to teach, each with the `lexemeId` to
use for it, its `headword`, and `usedAs` — the form or forms the story actually used. The reader
highlights those in the original, and would like to highlight the same word in your translation so
they can see what it became.

**This does not change how you translate.** Translate exactly as described above, as if `words` were
not there. Do not choose a word because it is easy to point to, and do not keep a phrase awkward so
that a word survives. Only once the translation is finished, report what it says.

- One entry per word you were given, with the `lexemeId` exactly as it was given to you.
- `forms` lists the word or words **in your translation** that render it, copied character for
  character from your `text` — as inflected, in the case you wrote it. The word itself, not the
  sentence around it; a fixed phrase is fine when the original was one, and an article is not part
  of the word.
- If the word has no single counterpart in your translation — you rendered it with a different
  construction, or it disappeared into the sentence — give an empty `forms` list. That is honest; a
  guess is worse.
- The program finds these strings in your text to mark them. One that does not appear verbatim will
  not be marked, so copy from what you wrote and not from what you meant to write.

## Above all

Same number of parts, same order, faithful, and readable. The reader is checking themselves against
this, so a translation that quietly differs from the original is worse than no translation at all.
