"""The tracked list of providers Acervo knows about.

`models/catalogue.json` ships the *list* and never a credential: `keyEnv` and `requires` name
environment variables, and a value never appears in the file. It is the only place a provider's
model id, endpoint and capabilities are written down, and — unlike the dictionary artifact, which is
described twice because one reader runs in a browser — it is described once, here, because the only
reader is Python.

Row order is the default preference order, and within a row so is model order. With no chain
configured the walk is provider by provider and, inside each, model by model: every credentialed row
that serves the kind, each of its models for that kind in turn. A row names *several* models per kind
because a free tier is metered per model — two models with 500 requests a day each are a thousand
requests a day, and the second is reached by the first one's 429.

The unit of choice is therefore a (provider, model) pair, not a provider. Settings ▸ Providers
enables, disables and reorders those pairs; this file is the list they are chosen from and the order
they fall back in when nobody has chosen.
