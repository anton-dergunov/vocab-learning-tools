"""What was asked of which model, and what came back.

There was no record of any of this. A chain could walk nine pairs, be refused by every one for the
same reason, sleep four minutes and walk them again — and leave behind a `passedOver` array inside
whichever response eventually succeeded, or nothing at all if none did. Working out *why* a picture
took six minutes meant reading the code and guessing, which is how a schema that asked for one field
out of eight survived two deployments.

So: **one line per attempt**, written where `chain.walk` already knows the outcome. The line names
the caller, the pair, what happened, how long it took, and — when the answer was refused for its
shape — the reason it was refused. That last part is the one that pays: it is the difference between
"unusable" and "it returned only senseId".

**The package emits; it does not configure.** `acervo.models` may not import `Settings`
(`test_layering.py`), and it should not care where a log lives in any case. It writes to an ordinary
logger and stops there; `services/models.py`, which already reads `Settings`, decides whether that
goes to a file and where. A deployment that installs no handler loses the lines and nothing else.

Nothing here formats a credential. Every detail on a `ProviderError` is redacted at construction
(`redact.py`), which is the property this module leans on rather than re-implements — a message
cleaned only on its way to a log has a path that skips the cleaning, and this repository is public.
