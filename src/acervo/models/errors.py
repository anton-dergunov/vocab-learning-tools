"""What went wrong, in a vocabulary that knows nothing about Acervo's wire.

The split matters and is the plan's acceptance boundary. This package decides *what kind of thing*
went wrong — a closed seven-value `Reason`. `acervo.services.models` decides what Acervo's API calls
that, because `llm_rate_limited` and its siblings carry Acervo's HTTP statuses and prose written for
the owner, and shipping those into a package meant to stand alone would defeat the point.

The division that carries the locked fall-through rule is between the two exception classes, not
between reasons: `ProviderUnavailable` is retried at the next row, `ProviderRefused` never is. An
authentication failure or a rejected configuration is a mistake to fix, not a condition to route
around; falling through on it hides the mistake and spends money elsewhere.

`unusable` and `empty` are the two reasons a *caller* raises rather than `classify`, and it is retryable for the
same argument the rule rests on. A model that answers with the wrong shape has not revealed a
mistake in the deployment — it has revealed that this model cannot do this job, which is exactly
what a chain of alternatives is for. It is also the only failure the owner can do nothing about: a
key can be rotated and a project can be fixed, but "this model does not follow a schema" is a fact
about the model. Falling through records the pair in `passed_over` like any other, so nothing is
hidden; refusing outright meant a weaker head of the chain made every stronger row behind it
unreachable.
