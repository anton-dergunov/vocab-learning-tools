"""The one hand-written adapter: Cloudflare images and Cloudflare audio.

LiteLLM covers Cloudflare *text* and neither of the other two, and this is the whole of the gap. The
logic is lifted from `experiments/image_benchmark/image_benchmark_runner.py`'s `run_cloudflare`, which already works
against the live service — including the awkward part: FLUX.2 Klein requires `multipart/form-data`
even for a text-only prompt, and a JSON body comes back as a 400 naming a required property
`multipart` (`docs/operations/cloudflare-workers-ai.md`). The `(None, value)` field tuples are what
make an HTTP client send a multipart boundary without claiming the scalars are uploaded files.

It is copied rather than imported: `experiments/` is outside the distribution, and
`test_layering.py` enforces that nothing shipping reaches into it. It is on httpx rather than
`requests` because httpx emits the identical multipart body and is the one HTTP library this
service already carries.

The reverse — the benchmark calling *this* instead of keeping `run_cloudflare` — is possible and
deliberately not done. Its candidates launch under `uv run --no-project`, so `acervo` is not
importable in the child at all, and giving it one would change how every benchmark child is
launched for a set of candidates that are all `enabled: false` and whose evaluation is finished.
The duplication is one function, pinned by tests on both sides. Revisit it when a new hosted
candidate is benchmarked, which is the first moment it costs anything.

Failures go through `call.classify()`, the same table LiteLLM's exceptions go through, so a
Cloudflare 429 and a Gemini 429 are the same kind of thing to the chain above.
