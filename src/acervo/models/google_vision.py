"""The Cloud Vision adapter: Google's OCR, which LiteLLM does not reach.

One route, `images:annotate`, asked for `DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION` — the dense-text reader, which
answers a page as blocks, paragraphs, words and symbols, each word with its outline and each symbol
with the break that follows it. That structure is the whole reason to use it rather than a
multimodal model: the geometry is measured rather than described, and nothing is transcribed that
is not on the page. `experiments/photo-capture/` measured it against RapidOCR on the NAS and chose
it.

What comes back is `OcrWord`s, in Vision's reading order, with Vision's names gone: a break type is
one of four words, and the block and paragraph a word sat in survive as two numbers.

Authentication and failure are `google_auth.py`'s, shared with Cloud Text-to-Speech.
