"""A chain of (provider, model) pairs, walked in order.

It falls through on 429 and 5xx and never on anything else. That rule is the locked one and it is
the whole of this module's judgement: an authentication failure or a rejected configuration is a
mistake to fix, not a condition to route around, and falling through on it hides the mistake and
spends money at the next provider.

**The unit is a pair, not a provider.** A free tier is metered per model, so two models with 500
requests a day each are a thousand requests a day and the second is reached by the first one's 429.
The default walk is therefore provider by provider and, inside each, model by model — the order the
catalogue lists them in.

A refusal is also remembered, in `cooldown.py`: a pair that has just been rate limited goes to
the back of the queue for a while, so an exhausted free tier is not re-probed on every entry. It is
only ever an ordering hint — when every pair is resting the hints are ignored and the chain is
walked as written, which is what makes recovery automatic without knowing anyone's reset hour.

**A caller with somebody waiting may race.** Given `hedge_after`, a pair that has been silent for
longer than a healthy answer takes is not waited out to its timeout: the next pair is asked beside
it and the first usable answer wins. Measured against the free Gemini tier, the same model that
answers a resolve in 0.8 s sometimes takes 23 s, and a connection that never opens costs the whole
bound — two failures the walk used to serve in sequence, one after another, to a person watching a
spinner. Everything else about the walk holds: at most two pairs are in flight, a retryable failure
starts the next pair, a terminal one still stops, and the answer names the pair that answered.

The other contract here is provenance. `Answer.provider_id` and `Answer.model` name the pair that
*answered*, and `attempts` names every pair tried, oldest first. A fall-through that left `modelId`
naming the first choice would be a bug, so the answer is rewritten as it comes back out rather than
assembled by the caller from what it asked for.

A bare id is shorthand for "this row, every model it offers for this kind, in the order it lists

leave the models to the catalogue. A pair is "this row, exactly this model" — the shape the owner's
record stores, because a free tier is metered per model and the owner is choosing buckets rather
than vendors.

A widening rather than an overload: an id names a *group* of pairs, not a second kind of thing.
`Candidate.named` and `Answer.attempts` are already this tuple, so a stored choice and a recorded
attempt are the same shape and can be compared without a mapping layer.

    An **empty** sequence is not the same thing. It means every model was switched off deliberately,
    and it resolves to nothing at all. The distinction is the whole reason this takes a `Sequence |
    None` rather than a list: "I have not chosen" and "I choose none" look identical in a list and
    mean opposite things, and conflating them made unticking the last model silently fall back to
    the server's order.

    Otherwise, exactly the choices given, in that order.

    **A retired model is refused; an uncredentialed row is skipped.** The line is whether the state
    is legitimate. Not holding a key is expected — ordering three providers on a deployment that
    holds one key is the entire point of a chain. A pair naming a model the catalogue does not offer
    is a state nothing is supposed to produce, and skipping it is silently wrong twice over: retire
    both of a row's models and `unconfigured()` would report a key as missing when it is plainly
    set, and retire one and capture would quietly walk half the chain the owner configured, forever,
    with no symptom.
