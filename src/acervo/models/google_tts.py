"""The Cloud Text-to-Speech adapter: Google's own speech API, which LiteLLM does not reach.

One route, `text:synthesize`, serves two quite different families of voice, and the row says which
is which rather than this module:

- **Standard and WaveNet voices** exist per language, carry the language in their name
  (`es-ES-Wavenet-F`) and take no direction at all. These are the character-metered voices with the
  large free allowance, and they are what reads a headword.
- **Gemini voices** are named once (`Kore`) and speak any language. They are selected by
  `voice.modelName`, and they take a free-text delivery direction in `input.prompt` — a field of its
  own, so an example's emotion shapes the reading without ever being read out.

Authentication is Google's application default credentials, exactly as for the `vertex` row, and
lives in `google_auth.py` beside Cloud Vision's.

Failures go through `call.classify`, the same table every other provider's do, so a Google 429 is the
same kind of thing to the chain as a Cloudflare one.
