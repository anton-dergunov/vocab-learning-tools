"""Saying one piece of text, over a chain of speech models, in its own language.

Two decisions live here and nowhere else.

**Only a model that speaks the language is asked.** The catalogue says which languages each model
covers — Aura is English, Google's WaveNet voices exist per language, Gemini's speak anything — and a
pair that cannot say Russian is left out of the walk for Russian rather than asked and refused. When
nothing in the chain can, that is its own answer (`NoVoice`), because "your chain has no Russian
voice" is something the owner can fix and a refusal from the first provider would hide it.

**A direction reaches only a voice that can follow one.** The emotion is sent where the answering
model declares `style: instruction`, and the result says whether it was, so the stored clip records
the delivery it actually got rather than the one that was hoped for.
