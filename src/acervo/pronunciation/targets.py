"""What a pronunciation reads, found in the wire-shaped records of one word.

Four kinds of thing can be spoken, and each carries its own language rather than assuming the word's:
a definition is in `definitionLang`, which is often the learner's own language rather than the one
being learned, and an example says what it is written in.

**The *use* is decided here; which order reads it is not.** A headword and a definition are `words`;
an example and an attestation are `examples` — and only an example has an emotion to give, since an
attestation is a sentence the learner met rather than one written to be remembered. Which of the two
orders reads each use is the owner's answer, held in `pronunciation_settings`, and this package may
not read that: it stands alone beside the provider package and the article view. So the service maps
use to order, and this module never learns that an order exists.
