"""Acervo's binding to the story pipeline: words in, a story and its pictures out.

The other half of the split `acervo.stories` makes, and the same split `services/images.py` makes
against `acervo.images`. That package knows what a story is; this one knows whose words they are,
which chain writes it, which language it is translated into, where the pictures go and what
Acervo's API calls a failure.

Every operation is read (transaction) → call (**no** transaction, tens of seconds of it) → write
(transaction), for `services/loops.py`'s reason: a repository function is a transaction and owns
its session, and a model call inside one blocks every other request while it runs.

**A story's state is derived, and this is where that pays.** `create` writes the `stories` row and
its `storyWords` with no parts at all; the job fills them in. So a story whose job failed to queue,
or failed outright, simply reads as one that was asked for and never written — there is no status
column to get out of step with what happened, and Try again queues another.

**Each step re-derives what is missing from the graph** rather than being handed it, which is what
makes a retry cost only what it has to: `draw_pictures` draws the parts with no `imageRef`, so a
run that lost its last picture to a timeout redraws one picture and not four.
