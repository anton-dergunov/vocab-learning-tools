"""Forwarding a fixed set of retrieval routes to the corpus, on the browser's behalf.

The alternative — exposing the retrieval service to the browser directly — means a second hostname,
a second CORS configuration, an unauthenticated read API on the network, and the operator token for
channel mutations somewhere near a browser. The proxy costs one router and removes all four
(`docs/features/spoken-clips.md` §2.9). The retrieval service stays bound to the internal compose
network and is never published.

**The body is passed through verbatim**, which is the one place Acervo's `{"data": …}` envelope does
not apply, and it is deliberate: `web/src/clips.ts` builds the *packaged* typed client with this
proxy as its base URL, so the client that the retrieval repository ships and tests is used unchanged
rather than reimplemented against a rewrapped shape. Rewrapping would mean maintaining a second
copy of its response types in two languages, forever, to gain nothing.

**The operator token never leaves this process.** Acervo holds it as deployment configuration and
attaches it to the mutating channel calls, exactly as a provider key is held. Because the body is
forwarded rather than built here, that is enforced rather than merely intended: a forwarded body
containing the token is refused instead of passed on, so the test can assert the whole value is
absent from the whole response — the same assertion `GET /models` makes about a provider key.
