"""Acervo's binding to the clip pipeline: the graph and the corpus in, clip examples out.

The other half of the split `acervo.clips` makes, and the same split `services/images.py` makes
against `acervo.images`. `acervo.clips` knows what a good clip is; this module knows whose word it
is, where the corpus answers, which chain judges and what Acervo's API calls a failure — and it
speaks the same `llm_*` codes, through the same `services.models.refusal`, because a clip that could
not be chosen and an entry that could not be written should fail alike.

Every operation is read (transaction) → search (**no** transaction) → model call (**no**
transaction) → write (transaction). A repository function is a transaction and owns its own session;
a model call of up to two minutes inside one would block every other request for as long as it ran.

Nothing here is a second write path. Rows go through `repository.graph.merge_graph`, the same route
a phone's writes take, with the same validation and the same revision allocation.
