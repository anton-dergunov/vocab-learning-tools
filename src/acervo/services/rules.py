"""The owner's standing rules, and the one place they are joined to a prompt.

Settings ▸ Rules is free text — "I am vegan, so never show or mention meat", "I read Spanish at B2"
— and it reaches every text call that writes something the owner will read: entries, the article
conversation, picture briefs, stories and the choice of clips. Not the resolver, which only names
the word a scrap of text is about, and not narration, which cuts a story into passages and may not
change a word of it. Voices and image models are never given it: what they draw and say is what a
text call already wrote.

`with_rules` is applied here, in the binding layer, to text a service already loaded, so the
enrichment packages are handed a prompt and never learn where part of it came from.
