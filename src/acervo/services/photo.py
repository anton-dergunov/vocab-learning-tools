"""Photo capture's binding layer: a photo in, a page a finger can tap out, and the photo kept.

`acervo.ocr` knows how to turn an engine's words into a page and nothing about Acervo; this module
knows the rest — which engine the owner's chain names, which languages the owner studies, where the
media root is, and what happens to a photo nobody adds.

**Who writes the file and who writes the row.** A media file and the row naming it must be written
by the same party, or one of them is a lie — and here the photo arrives long before any row. So:

1. `read` stores the photo, EXIF-free, content-addressed, as `photos/{owner}/pending/{digest}.jpg`,
   and answers the reference it will have *once kept*: `photos/{owner}/{digest}.jpg`.
2. A save whose attestation names that reference hands `place` to `merge_graph`, which moves the
   file out of `pending/` inside the write's transaction and moves it back if the write fails. A row
   can therefore never name a missing file, and there is still one writer of the graph.
3. `sweep` removes pending photos older than a day. A photo nobody added costs nothing.

Because the reference names the final place from the start, nothing ever rewrites one, and a second
word saved from the same photo finds the file already kept. A kept photo is not removed when its
attestation is tombstoned: undo restores the tombstone, and one photo may back several words.
