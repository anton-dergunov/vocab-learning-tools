"""Acervo's binding to the image pipeline: settings and the graph in, a picture on disk out.

The other half of the split `acervo.images` makes, and the same split `services/models.py` makes
against `acervo.models`. `acervo.images` knows what a picture is; this module knows whose it is,
where it goes, which chain draws it and what Acervo's API calls a failure to draw one — and it
speaks the same `llm_*` codes, through the same `services.models.refusal`, because a picture that
could not be drawn and an entry that could not be written should fail alike.

**The unit of work is one model call**, and each one is an ordinary synchronous route in the
threadpool — the shape capture already has, for a sharper reason than symmetry. A whole-lexeme route
would outlive the client's own timeout while the server kept drawing; the client would retry and the
picture would be drawn, and billed, twice.

Every operation is read (transaction) → model call (**no** transaction) → write (transaction). A
repository function is a transaction and owns its own session; an image call of up to two minutes
inside one would block every other request for as long as it ran.

Nothing here is a second write path. Rows go through `repository.graph.merge_graph`, the same route
a phone's writes take, with the same validation and the same revision allocation. The server writes
the row as well as the file because it is the only party holding both — a picture is not a capture
draft, which is a proposal for a person to review; there is nothing here to review and nothing the
client could have produced.

    first; the absence of a rendering model is what says it.
