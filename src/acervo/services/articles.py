"""Saving an article: a parsed document in, one atomic write out (`processing-flow.md` §4.9).

The one writer of articles. The device parses the YAML — `web/src/yaml.ts` stays the only place the
projection is understood — and sends the resulting `ArticleDraft` as JSON; everything from there on
is here, so the interface, the headless capture job and any future client save the same way.

The diff is by the ids the document carries, and needs no content matching: a record carrying an id
is the one it names, a record without one is new, and a stored record the document no longer
mentions is tombstoned rather than erased — which is what lets undo put it back. Nothing is recreated
to avoid a diff; ids stay put across an edit.

**The device says what it edited from.** `base` maps every record of the entry its replica held to
the revision it held it at. That revision is what each write states, so a document edited from a
stale replica is refused by the merge rather than laid over a newer row; and only records in `base`
are tombstoned, so a sense added on another device and not yet pulled here is never removed by a
document that could not have mentioned it. A headless save has no replica and sends no `base`; it
is diffed against the stored rows.
