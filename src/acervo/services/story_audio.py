"""Acervo's binding to story narration: a part in, one recording and its row out.

The other half of the split `acervo.stories.narrate` makes, and the sibling of `services/stories.py`
(the pictures) and `services/pronunciations.py` (a word). This is where it is decided *whose* voice
reads it, and it reuses what those two already answer: the chain a pair is chosen from, the way a
model's refusal is spoken, and the file-then-row write.

**A story is read in one voice, but the pin is a preference and not a cage.** The first part to be
recorded walks the owner's order, and whichever (provider, model, voice) answers is asked for every
later passage and part. If that pair then refuses — a daily quota is the case this exists for — the
next pair in the order records the rest instead. A story that changes voice between parts is worse
than one read throughout in a single voice and far better than one that stops after part one, which
is what insisting cost: the pinned pair was the free row whose allowance had run out, the chain of one
had nothing to fall through to, and three parts stayed silent for a day. **Within a part the pin never
moves**, so a paragraph is never read by two voices. The pin is read back off the graph — the first
part already recorded — and never remembered, which is what lets a retry, a route and a job agree
without coordinating.

**Only a voice that can take a direction reads a directed story.** The passages exist to carry one, so
a pair that cannot take one turns four calls a part into four times the cost of one, for nothing: on
the deployment this was found on, every stored passage read `direction=""` because the row at the head
of the order goes through LiteLLM, whose Vertex speech transformation has no field for a prompt at all.
So the expressive order is filtered to the pairs that declare `style: instruction`, and **when none of
them can be reached the part is read whole, in one call, with no passages** — a plain reading of the
whole paragraph rather than an expensive one that is plain anyway.

**A part is one file per passage, and never one joined file.** A directed voice is asked for one
passage at a time, each with its own direction (`stories/narrate.py` decides where they break), and
each recording is stored as it came. The alternative was tried: join them, remember where each one
starts, and seek. It does not work, because **a browser seeks a compressed stream to a page boundary**
— one second, in the Ogg libsndfile writes — so a passage started after its first words or after the
end of the one before it, unpredictably, and the element reports the time that was *asked for* rather
than the time it gave, so there is nothing to correct against. A file that begins where the passage
begins needs no seek and cannot be wrong. A clear voice records one passage covering the whole part,
so the shape is the same either way and the reader simply has nothing to tap.

Every operation is read (transaction) → calls (**no** transaction, tens of seconds of them) → write
(transaction), for `services/stories.py`'s reason.
