"""The meaning map's binding layer: the graph in, a stored map out, and its regions named later.

`acervo.meaning` knows how to draw a map and nothing about whose. This module reads the owner's
senses, keeps the embedding cache and the drawn map beside the database (`Settings.maps_path`), and
says on the wire what a missing language is called.

**A map is computed when it is asked for and its input has changed**, never on a timer and never as a
job. It is local CPU for seconds — no model call, no allowance to wait on — and the job runner does
one thing at a time, so a map queued behind an import's enrichment would be an hour out of date. The
one slow draw is the first, when every sense of a language is embedded; after that only the senses
whose words changed are. One lock per owner and language keeps two devices from drawing the same map.

**Names come after, from a job**, because they are a model call: the map is stored with the words
nearest each region's centre as its labels and `names: "pending"`, and `map.name` fills the names in
when it runs. A name job for a layout that has since been replaced does nothing — the newer layout
asked for its own.
