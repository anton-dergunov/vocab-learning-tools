"""Acervo's binding to the provider package: `Settings` in, `llm_*` error codes out.

Not to be confused with `acervo.models`, which is the provider package itself and knows nothing
about Acervo. This module is the other half of that split, and the split is deliberate:

- `acervo.models` decides **what kind of thing went wrong** — a closed seven-value `Reason`.
- This module decides **what Acervo's API calls that** — the table below.

`llm_rate_limited` and its siblings carry Acervo's HTTP statuses and prose written for the owner, so
they do not belong in a package meant to stand alone; conversely, "429 means try the next one" is
provider knowledge and does not belong in every caller. The table is the seam.

**The mapping is a contract, not an implementation detail.** `scripts/ingest_vocabulary_file.py`
retries on exactly `llm_rate_limited`, `llm_unavailable` and `llm_unreachable`. A change here
changes the retry behaviour without changing a line of the retry code.

`refusal()` is public for the same reason: `services/images.py` binds the *same* provider package
and must speak the *same* codes, so a picture that could not be drawn and an entry that could not be
written fail alike. A second mapping would be a second contract.

The call journal is bound here for the same reason it is mapped here. `acervo.models.journal` writes
to a logger and stops, because the package may not read `Settings`; this module knows where the
deployment keeps its files, so this module is where the handler is attached.
