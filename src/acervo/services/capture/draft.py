"""Turning the model's answer into an ArticleDraft.

The exact shape `web/src/yaml.ts` reads, so the review surface renders a generated entry through the

to name the attestation it was drawn from and both are created by the same save.

This is the highest-risk block in the whole capture path. Every guard below is deliberate.
