"""Model call one: what is this text about?

Asked two ways. Capture asks it on the owner's `text` chain as the first of its two calls. A photo tap
asks it alone, as the **quick look-up** (`POST /capture/resolve`), on the `quick` chain and with a
tight budget, because a finger is still on the glass: the same question, plus what the word means in
this sentence, answered by a model ordered for speed. `/capture` can then take that resolution
rather than pay for resolve a second time (`pipeline.given_resolution`).
