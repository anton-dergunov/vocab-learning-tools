"""Model call two: build the article.

It returns the model that answered alongside the article, because under a provider chain that is
not knowable before the call: a 429 at the first row is answered by the second, and the locked
contract is that the entry records the model that *answered*. Reading it from the configuration
instead — which is what this route did while there was only ever one provider — would leave
`modelId` naming a model that produced nothing.
