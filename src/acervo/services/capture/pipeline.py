Shared by the interactive route, which returns the proposal for review, and the headless capture
job, which saves it to the Inbox. Nothing here writes.

It is two halves, split at the duplicate check: `understand` and then compose. A photo tap asks for
the first half alone (`look_up`) and brings its answer back to `/capture`, so the quick call is not a
second pipeline and compose does not pay for resolve twice.
