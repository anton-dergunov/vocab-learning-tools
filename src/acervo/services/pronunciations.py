"""Acervo's binding to pronunciation: the graph and settings in, a clip on disk and a row out.

The other half of the split `acervo.pronunciation` makes, exactly as `services/images.py` is for
pictures. That package knows what to say and how to ask for it; this module knows whose word it is,
which chain reads it, where the file goes and what Acervo's API calls a failure.

**A clip is written by the server, file and row together**, for the reason a picture is: nobody else
holds both. The file lands first, under a name that changes with every recording, and the row second
through `graph.merge_graph` — the same write every phone makes. So a device that cached the previous
recording by its reference simply misses the new one and fetches it, and the previous file is removed
only once the row naming its successor has landed.

Every operation is read (transaction) → model call (**no** transaction) → write (transaction).

A selection is the one thing said and not kept: it names no record, so there is no row to put it in
and nothing to make stale. It is spoken and returned, and the call log is its only trace.
