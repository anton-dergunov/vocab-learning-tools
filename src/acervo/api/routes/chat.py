"""Chat: a question about one word in, prose and maybe a proposed edit out.

Writes nothing. A proposal is a suggestion the device applies to a draft and the reader approves;
the approval is an ordinary `POST /graph` through the same route every other writer uses. There is
no second write path here, and there is nothing to make one out of.

The model call runs in the threadpool for `capture.py`'s reason: one call of up to 120 seconds on
the event loop would stall every other request for two minutes.
