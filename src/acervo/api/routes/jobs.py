"""Reading the work the server is doing, and asking for more (`docs/plans/processing-flow.md` §4.8).

A route queues a job and reads its record; it never runs one. That is `acervo.work`'s, which this
package reaches only through `repository.jobs`.

Only the kinds a person can ask for directly are accepted here. A save queues `enrich` on its own;
this is for Try again, and for a bundle import that restores pictures before it asks for the rest.
