"""Capture: text in, an entry to review out — or, headless, a job that files entries in the Inbox.

`POST /capture` is synchronous because a person is waiting to review the result. `POST
/capture/resolve` is its first half alone, for a photo tap, and `/capture` accepts what it returned. `POST /captures`
is the headless transports' door: it queues a `capture` job and answers at once. Both run
`services/capture/pipeline.propose`, so there is one pipeline.

The interactive pipeline runs in the threadpool. Two model calls of up to 120 seconds each on the event
loop would stall every other request for four minutes.
