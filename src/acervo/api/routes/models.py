"""Which providers this server can use, and which ones this owner wants.

Two routes and no vocabulary. The choice is owner-scoped server state, never replicated: it decides
what the owner's words are *made of* — which model wrote a definition, at what cost, to what quality
— and an entry captured from a phone should be built by the same model as one captured from a
laptop. It also has to be readable by the server at request time, because the server is what calls
the model and the key never leaves it.

Deliberately **not** `schemaVersion`-gated. That number guards the replicated graph wire, and its
client-side twin decides whether a device's whole IndexedDB replica is wiped; bumping it for a route
that adds no field to any replicated record would wipe every replica for nothing. An old client
never calls this route, so there is nothing to protect.
