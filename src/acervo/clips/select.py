"""The one model call: which recorded utterance, if any, is a good example of which sense.

One call per *lexeme*, covering all of its senses against one bounded candidate set. The model is
the last and best quality gate, not the retrieval mechanism (`docs/features/spoken-clips.md` §2.7): the
corpus does IR over millions of segments because it must, and Acervo spends one frontier call per
word on the judgement a feature cannot make — reading a messy fragment and deciding whether it is
really an instance of *this* sense.

Three things follow, and all three are the point.

**Refusing is the default, not the failure.** A thin corpus must produce articles with no clips,
never articles with bad clips. A sense with no selection is a successful outcome and is not counted
as anything.

**The stored text is the corpus's sentence, verbatim.** The model chooses; it never rewrites, trims
or joins (§2.6). Where a passage starts and ends is an open research question in the other
repository, and a model that quietly re-cut it would make those measurements meaningless and break
the audit that `clipRef` exists for.

**An id the request did not offer is dropped and counted, never a refusal of the whole word.** This
is the deliberate difference from `images/brief.parse_reply`, which raises: a hallucinated id is a
prompt bug to fix, and refusing the batch would throw away the good selections with it.

This package stands alone. It imports `acervo.models`, `acervo.article` and its own corpus client,
and nothing else of Acervo's — so the request path and the batch sweep are two callers of one
pipeline rather than two pipelines.
