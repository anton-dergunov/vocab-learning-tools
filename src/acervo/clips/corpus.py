"""The narrow client against the spoken-usage corpus, and the only place its wire shape is read.

The corpus is a **separate repository and a separate service** (`docs/features/spoken-clips.md` §2.2):
Acervo does not hold it, does not import `speech_retrieval` and never opens its database. It talks
to one pinned `/api/v1` contract over HTTP, and the version it talks to is
`deploy/acervo/speech/pin.json`.

Written by hand rather than taken from the wheel, deliberately. Installing that package to reach it
would drag FastAPI, uvicorn, yt-dlp and simplemma into Acervo's image to make four GET requests, and
it would put the service *inside* the process the whole design keeps it outside of.

This module stands alone the way `models/cloudflare.py` does: no `acervo.settings`, no
`acervo.errors`, no graph. It speaks its own refusals and `services/clips.py` translates them, for
the same reason `acervo.models` decides *what kind of thing* went wrong while `services/models.py`
decides what Acervo's wire calls it.

**Everything the corpus says is turned into a `Candidate` here and nowhere else.** A raw response
dict must not escape this module — that is the rule `dictionary.ts` lives by for the artifact format,
and it is what makes a pinned-version bump one file to read rather than a search.
