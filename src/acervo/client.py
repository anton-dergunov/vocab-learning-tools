"""The one HTTP client against the Acervo API.

Batch jobs write through this, against the service's own graph route: same route, same validation,
same revision allocation as a phone. One writer process, one pipeline — the rule capture transports
already live by, where adding a transport must not add a second pipeline.

It replaces two copies of the same thirty lines, which had drifted apart in three ways that each
mattered: one used a 600-second timeout and the other 300; one carried the error `code` and the other
threw it away; and both inferred the method from the body, so a bodyless POST — which is what
`/graph/reset` and `/session/refresh` are — could not be expressed at all.

**No retries live here.** The file ingestion retries on exactly `llm_rate_limited`, `llm_unavailable`
and `llm_unreachable`, with delays its own tests assert; a retry layer inside the transport would
change that behaviour without changing a line of the retry code, which is the failure the error-code
taxonomy exists to prevent. A caller that wants retries owns them.
