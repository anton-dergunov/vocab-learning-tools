"""Signing and reading Acervo's own tokens, and nothing else.

A leaf, deliberately. It knows JWT, a secret and a per-user key; it does not know what a request is,
where accounts are stored, or what a job does. That is what lets **both** sides use it: `api/auth.py`
mints a session from a route, and `services/loops.py` mints a render-scoped token from work that
`work/` may not import `api/` to reach.

Before this existed, minting lived in `api/auth.py`, and the loop pipeline needing a token would
have made `work/` reach back into the request path through a service — which is exactly the shape
`test_layering.py` forbids. Moving the signing rule here keeps it in one place rather than two.
