"""How this owner wants words pronounced. One row per owner, or none — and none is a real answer.

The `image_settings` doctrine: **no record means "use the deployment default"**, nothing creates a
row eagerly, and every read is a pure read. Server state rather than a device preference, because the
recording happens on the server — a phone that has never opened Settings still gets the voices the
owner chose. Whether a clip is *kept on a device* is the opposite case and lives on the device.

This module stores what it is given. Which voices exist is the catalogue's question, and
`acervo.services.pronunciations` is where a document is held to it.

# sentences" — with a separate boolean deciding whether a direction was sent. That boolean only ever
# gated the direction, so switching emotion off still spent the expensive voice on every sentence.
# Now the orders are named for their capability and each use picks one, which makes choosing the
# directed order *be* asking for emotion: one mechanism where there were two, and the cheap voice
# finally reachable for examples as well.
#
# A selection reads with the `words` order. Three uses, two orders, and deliberately no third chain:
# any voice is a legitimate answer to either question.
