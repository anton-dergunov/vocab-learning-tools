"""The owner's model chains. One row per owner, or none — and none is a real answer.

Unlike `sync_state`, absence here is not a gap to be filled: no record means "use the deployment
default". Nothing creates a row eagerly and there is no `ensure_` function, so every read is a pure
read with nothing to write when it is missing — a stronger guarantee than the cursor manages, not a
weaker one. Eager creation would have to invent a value, and both candidates are wrong: `{}` is
indistinguishable from absence, and snapshotting the deployment default would freeze a server
setting at the instant the account was made.

This module stores what it is given. It does not know the catalogue — which providers exist and
which models they offer is `acervo.models`'s question, and `acervo.services.models` is where a
document is held to it. Two validators would be one drift.
