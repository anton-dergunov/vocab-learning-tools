"""How this owner wants the spoken-usage corpus consulted. One row per owner, or none.

The same three-state doctrine as `image_settings` and `model_selection`, and for the same reason:
**no record means "use the deployment default"**. Nothing creates a row eagerly and there is no
`ensure_` function, so every read is a pure read with nothing to write when it is missing. Eager
creation would have to invent a value, and snapshotting today's default would freeze it at the
instant the account was made.

Two fields, and deliberately not more. Which channels the corpus harvests is the retrieval
service's own catalogue (`docs/plans/spoken-clips.md` §2.10) and Acervo ships no copy of it; how many
candidates a call sees is a research knob that belongs in
`docs/plans/clip-selection-experiment.md`, not in a settings screen.

`self_contained_only` is the first boolean that is really a *taste* — how authentic, how tidy — and
a growing list of those is the wrong shape for that question. `docs/plans/clip-curation.md` is where
that goes next.

This module stores what it is given, exactly as `image_settings` does.
