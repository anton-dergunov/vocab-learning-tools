"""The owner-scoped graph: the cursor, revision allocation, the merge, and the tombstone sweep.

One strictly increasing sequence per owner, shared by all eleven tables and never one per table. A
record left at revision zero is invisible to every `revision > cursor` pull, permanently and
silently — the failure has no symptom until someone notices a word missing on another device weeks
later. The hook this replaces allocated in a save hook because the write route was not the only
writer; with the database in this process it collapses into one function every writer calls.

The sequence row's *id* is the dataset identity. Rebuilding the database mints a new one, which is
the only thing that stops a client asking for revisions the new database has not reached yet.
