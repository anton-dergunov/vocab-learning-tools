"""One word and its senses, assembled from wire-shaped records. The view every enrichment reads.

One view model with two feeders, the way `articleFor` and `articleFromDraft` both build one
`Article` on the client. `build_articles` takes the `changes` mapping the graph route speaks, so the
worker sweep feeds it a `client.pull_graph()` payload and a service feeds it rows the repository
projected — neither knows which. That is what keeps the interactive path and the unattended one on
one pipeline rather than two.

**It lives here rather than in `acervo.images` because it was never about pictures.** A clip
selector wants the same lexeme, the same senses and the same examples, and pronunciation audio will
want them next; what differs is the rule each applies afterwards. So this module holds the
assembling and nothing else, and each pipeline keeps its own judgement beside it —
`acervo.images.article.anchor_for` decides which example a picture illustrates, and no other package
has an opinion about that.

This module is **pure**: it imports nothing of Acervo's, opens no connection and reads no graph, and
`tests/unit/server/test_layering.py` enforces that. It and `acervo.models` are the two Acervo things
an enrichment package may import.

Deliberately a duplicate of the shape `web/src/selectors.ts` derives rather than a shared one.
