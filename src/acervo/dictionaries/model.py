"""What a compiled dictionary entry says.

Deliberately **not** `ArticleDraft`. External entries are render-only: they never reach the database,
never carry record ids, and never round-trip through `parseArticle` — `docs/acervo-external-
dictionaries.md` §11.3 settled that, because Acervo's seven-value part-of-speech enum does not
survive contact with real dictionaries and `parseArticle` rejects the free-text label that replaces
it.

Two differences from the draft shape are size decisions rather than modelling ones. §11.0a measured
the `fields` tier as larger than HTML raw and traced it to `definitionLang` and `order` being
repeated on every sense; `definitionLang` is hoisted to the entry, where it is uniform for a whole
dictionary anyway, and `order` is deleted because a JSON array is already ordered.
