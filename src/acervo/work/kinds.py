"""What a job kind is, and the registry of them (`docs/architecture/server.md`, "Jobs").

A kind declares a name, its steps, and a handler. It gets queuing, retry, pacing, cancellation, the
event stream and the progress strip without writing any of them — which is the whole contract a
future processor has to meet.
