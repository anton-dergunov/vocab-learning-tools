"""`map.name`: a model names the regions of a map that has just been drawn.

A job because it is a model call, and a map must never wait on one: the map is already on screen with
the words nearest each region's centre, and the names replace them when this finishes. The subject is
the language, so a second drawing before the first is named queues nothing new — and a job whose map
has since been redrawn finds it stale and does nothing.
