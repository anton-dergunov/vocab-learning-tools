"""`capture`: a submission of text turned into Inbox entries, with nobody reviewing.

See `docs/architecture/server.md`, "Jobs".

The submission is the unit, and the words are its output: stream-mode resolve discovers where each
entry ends while it runs. For each one the job stops at a word the owner already holds, or composes
the entry and saves it through the same save the interface makes — filed in the Inbox, and enriched
by a child `enrich` job.

Progress is recorded on the step as it goes (`consumedLines`, and one outcome per word), so a job put
back to wait out a busy provider carries on from the entry it was on, and a job that fails says
exactly how much of the text it finished. That is what a caller's checkpoint advances by.
