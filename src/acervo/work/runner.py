"""The runner: one thread, one job at a time, in the server process (`docs/architecture/jobs.md`).

It is a thread rather than a task because everything it calls is synchronous — the same service
functions a route hands to the thread pool — and the work is a socket waiting on a remote API, not
CPU. Concurrency is one: the model allowances are the owner's own.

Nothing resumes. A job still marked running when the process starts failed, and says so; the owner
presses Try again, which queues a new one. A deploy refuses while jobs are open rather than carry
their half-done state across a version.
