"""The translation call: the whole story at once, asked cold.

**The whole story, not a part at a time**, and that is the design rather than an optimisation. A
name, a nickname and a running joke have to read the same in every part, and a model shown one
paragraph in isolation has no way to know what it already called somebody. Per-part calls are also
where an off-by-one becomes possible at all.

Cold, because this is the opposite task to writing one. `TRANSLATE_PARAMS` asks for a low
temperature; a row that pins its own still wins.
