"""The story call: a few words in, a story in parts out.

One text call per story, asked hot — `WRITE_PARAMS` below. This is the only genuinely creative call
in Acervo, and it is the one place a low temperature would be actively wrong: the failure mode of a
cautious story is not an error, it is a story nobody reads twice, which is the whole mechanism.

`parse_reply` is the contract, and it is enforced twice on the happy path for `images/brief.py`'s
reason: once inside the chain's callback, so a model that cannot hold the shape is *passed over*
rather than ending the walk, and once after `walk` returns.

What it checks is what a schema could not. That every word asked for is accounted for; that a
reported surface form **actually appears in the text it was reported against**, because that string
is what the reader searches for and an invented one silently marks nothing; and that the part count
and sentence lengths are within what the prompt asked for, since a model that ignores those has not
written the thing the reader was built for.
