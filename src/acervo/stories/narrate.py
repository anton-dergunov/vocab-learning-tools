"""The narration call: split one part into passages, and say how each should be read.

A directed voice is asked for one *passage* at a time, and the model that is best at deciding where a
passage ends is a text model, not a rule. So a part goes through one cold call that returns its own
text cut into segments, each with a short direction — and **the model is never trusted with the
words**. `tile` finds every segment it returned inside the original, in order, and anything it left
out, changed or reworded stays in the story as a segment with no direction. What is spoken is
therefore always exactly what is written, and a segment's place in the text is nothing more than the
lengths of the segments before it.

Cold, for `translate.py`'s reason: this is copying with judgement, not writing.
