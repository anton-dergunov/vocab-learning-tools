"""The pictures: one brief call for the whole story, then one draw call per part.

**The brief covers every part at once**, which is the same argument `images/brief.py` makes for
batching a word's senses and matters more here. Each picture is drawn by a model that has never
seen the others, so anything that must stay the same across them — a man's jacket, a dog's collar —
has to be restated in every brief. Deciding those descriptions once, with all the parts in view, is
the only way four pictures read as four parts of one story. Since `continuity.py`, a later picture
may also be handed the earlier pictures of the people and places it shows again — but only where
the pair can read them, so the restated description is still what every picture stands on.

The draw call is `images/`-shaped on purpose: the style text is appended here rather than asked for
in the brief, so the same brief in another style is one substitution, and a `FRAME` states the
things every picture must obey.
