"""Who and where each picture of a story shows, and which earlier pictures a later one is drawn from.

**References are chosen by identity, never by position.** A text call labels every part's brief with
the characters it puts in frame and the one place it is set in, as stable ids. Part k is then given
the *first* picture of each character it shows and the *last* picture of its place, if either
appeared before — and nothing when nothing recurs. The case this exists for is *La invención
del Post-it*: part 1 is one man in a laboratory and part 2, years later, is a different man in a
church. Handing part 2 the first picture would have painted the first man's face onto the second.

The labels are a separate call over the briefs `illustrate.BriefWriter` already wrote, rather than
more fields in that prompt. `experiments/story-picture-reference` tried both: asked for ids as well,
the brief writer stopped restating the cast in every brief, which is its most important rule and the
one a part with no references relies on entirely. This call reads the briefs and changes none of them.

**At most two references.** A story has four pictures, so the last part could otherwise be handed all
three before it; two is the owner's choice and costs nothing that matters. The references are
explained in the prompt one by one — who in it to keep, whether its place is this one, who in it must
not be drawn — under `prompts/acervo_story_reference.md`, which puts the picture first: the run that
measured this found conditioned pictures that matched their references and were stiffer for it.
