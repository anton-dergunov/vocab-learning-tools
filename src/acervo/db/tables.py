"""The twenty-two owner-scoped tables, plus `users`.

Ported column for column and index for index from the PocketBase bootstrap migration this replaces.
Two of those indexes carry reasoning that must survive the move, and both comments are below.

Timestamps are `TEXT` of exactly 24 characters throughout. The migration already stored `created_at`
and `edited_at` that way; `captured_at`, `last_review` and `synced_at` were PocketBase `date` fields
normalised back to the same 24-character form on every read, so storing the wire form directly is
what removes a conversion rather than what adds one.
