"""The packed-blob artifact: how a compiled dictionary is laid out on disk.

Chosen by measurement in `docs/acervo-external-dictionaries.md` §11 — a packed blob plus a sidecar
index beat SQLite by 1.53x on total device bytes for the same corpus, and DEFLATE in frames of 256
entries beats per-entry compression by 57 % while keeping a lookup to one ~65 KiB frame decode.

`web/src/dictionary.ts` reads what this writes. The two files are the same format described twice,
so a change here is a change there.

Two details that are load-bearing and easy to get subtly wrong:

* **Keys are ordered by their UTF-8 bytes**, never by locale collation and never by the platform's
  own string comparison. JavaScript compares UTF-16 code units, which disagrees with UTF-8 byte
  order above the BMP, so a reader binary-searching one order over an index built in the other
  silently fails to find real entries.
* **Front-coding destroys random access**, which a binary search needs. Every `RESTART_INTERVAL`-th
  key is therefore stored whole and its offset recorded, so a search binary-searches the restart
  table and then scans at most one bucket.
