"""The speech container's command: the retrieval service, with Acervo's chain behind its providers.

`speech_retrieval.create_app` takes a `TranslationProvider` and a `WordAlignmentProvider` as
constructor arguments — a public entry point of that package — so the player's target text runs on
the owner's own chain without that repository gaining a LiteLLM dependency, a schema-dialect port or
an error-taxonomy mapping. It changes nothing at all (`docs/plans/spoken-clips.md` §2.13).

This file is the only place the two projects' vocabularies meet, and it is deliberately thin: the
call itself is `acervo.speech.provider.ChainGenerator`, which imports nothing of this service's and
is tested from a virtualenv that does not carry FastAPI, uvicorn, yt-dlp or Stanza. What is here is
the wiring that knows this version's prompts, schemas and exception types.

Without `ACERVO_TEXT_CHAIN` and a credential, no providers are injected and the service falls back
to its own behaviour — the authored caption where one exists, and no target text where none does.
