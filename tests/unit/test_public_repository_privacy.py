# Placeholder local parts, allowed on any domain.

# name a *provider* account: `docs/acervo-vertex-setup.md` tells the owner to bind an IAM role to
# their Google login, and `learner@account.example.com` there would be worse than useless — it
# implies a domain that cannot be a Google account, so a reader would copy something that cannot
# work. The address has to look like what they will actually type.
#
# **The local part is the identifying half**, which is why the exception is written here and not as
# an allowed domain. `address@gmail.com` names nobody; the leak this test exists to catch is a real
# local part, and that is caught on gmail.com exactly as before.
