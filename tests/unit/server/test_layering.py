"""The layering, enforced by imports rather than by remembering it.

Four rules, each of which stops being true silently:

- `api/` may not import `jobs/`, because capture, review and the sync API must work with the
  orchestrator down and must not know one exists.
- Nothing outside `repository/` may touch the database — the server-side twin of the rule the
  interface already lives by.
- `jobs/` and `consumers/` reach the graph through `client.py`, against the service's own route:
  same validation and same revision allocation as a phone. One writer, one pipeline.
- Nothing that ships imports `experiments/`.
- `models/` stands alone: it is a provider package, not an Acervo one.
- An enrichment pipeline — `images/`, `clips/` — may import the provider package and the article
  view, and nothing else of Acervo's, which is what lets a route and a batch sweep share one
  pipeline instead of writing it twice.
- `article.py` itself imports nothing of Acervo's at all, which is what makes it safe to be the one
  thing every enrichment shares.
- `speech/` is the translation seam the corpus calls back through: the provider package and nothing
  else of Acervo's, and nothing at all of the retrieval service's.
- `repository/` stores; it does not know the catalogue.
- `work/` runs jobs by calling `services/`, never `api/`; `services/` knows nothing of jobs; and a
  route reaches jobs only through `repository.jobs`.
