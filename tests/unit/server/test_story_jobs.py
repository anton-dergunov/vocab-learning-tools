"""The `story` job: write, translate, brief, draw — and, when switched on, read aloud.

Reading aloud is switched **off** for everything here, by the `models` fixture: this file is about
the four steps that make a story, and `test_story_audio.py` is about the fifth. A step that is off
is skipped, which is itself pinned there.

The models are faked at `acervo.models.call`'s own seams — `completion` and `image_generation` —
so this exercises the real chain, the real parsers and the real writes, and never the network.

What is pinned here is the two things the four-step shape exists for: that three good steps survive
a fourth that fails, and that a retry redraws only the pictures that are actually missing.
