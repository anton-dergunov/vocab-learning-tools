"""Reading a story aloud: one voice for the whole story, whatever the models do.

Against the real service, the real chains and the real encoder. What is stubbed is the two providers
and only them — the text model (`acervo.models.call.completion`) that cuts a part into passages, and
Cloud TTS's adapter, which answers with a real WAV and records what it was asked. So a test can say
which voice read a passage, whether a direction reached it, and which pair was never asked.
