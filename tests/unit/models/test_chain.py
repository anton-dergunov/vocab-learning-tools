"""The locked fall-through rule, and the provenance that goes with it.

The unit walked is a (provider, model) pair, not a provider: a free tier is metered per model, so a
row's second model is a second bucket reached by the first one's 429 rather than a spare.

Several of these assert a *call count* rather than an exception. That is deliberate: "never fallen
through" is a claim about what did not happen, and an exception type alone cannot tell the
difference between a pair that was skipped and one that was tried and refused.
