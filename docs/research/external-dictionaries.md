# External dictionaries — source research

**Status:** researched, measured, and Stage 1 built. Design §08 defines the storage stance and closes
with "out of scope for this iteration"; this document is the survey that brought it into scope, the
decisions that survived a first review, and in §11 the measurements that settled them. The catalogue
and the compiler now exist — see [`features/dictionaries.md`](../features/dictionaries.md) for
what was built and what it changed.

Two separate needs push toward published dictionaries:

1. **Glancing.** LLM composition costs money, needs the server, and takes up to five seconds.
   Looking a word up to *peek* at it should be instant and should work offline — and it is
   independently valuable to check a generated article against a human-compiled one. **This is the
   need that justifies the feature.**
2. **Grounding.** Design §09 names this "the highest-leverage change to the existing pipeline".
   [grounding-spike.md](../plans/grounding-spike.md) owns that experiment and it is
   **postponed** — too much else is unbuilt, and §1 below argues the expected benefit is narrower
   than §09 assumes. Grounding is a later, optional consumer of whatever this document produces, not
   its motivation.

Design §08 already fixed the storage stance: external dictionaries are **read-only files, read
directly, never ingested into PocketBase, never in the replica**, and the unit of installation is
"this dictionary on this device". Nothing below contradicts that.

Directions surveyed: `en → en/ru`, `es → es/en/ru`, `zh-Hans → zh/en/ru`, plus German, French and
Japanese as a representative sample. Figures are current as of the August 2026 Wiktionary dumps.

## §1 · Sense coverage is not the goal — condensation is

An earlier draft of this document recommended chasing **sense recall**: how many of the source's
senses appear in the generated article. That was wrong for this product, and the correction matters
enough to state plainly.

`picar` is the test case. The [Spanish Wiktionary entry](https://es.wiktionary.org/wiki/picar) lists
**37 numbered senses**. Sense 36 is "jactarse de algo con demasiada presunción"; sense 37 is
Argentine colloquial for "correr a toda prisa". Acervo currently generates three to five senses for
a word like this, and that is the right number for something a person will actually read. A
37-sense article does not teach `picar` better — it makes the word look like a chore and drives the
reader away from it.

So the dictionary's completeness is a **library property, not an article property**:

- **A short list is the deliverable.** Three to five senses that give the overall shape of the word,
  from which a reader can infer the rest in context. Condensation is the editorial work, and it is
  the thing the LLM is currently good at.
- **Obscure, regional and highly specific senses are opt-in.** They belong in the external
  dictionary, reachable on demand, and enter the personal store only when someone deliberately adds
  one because they met it and want to remember it. A regional slang sense arriving unbidden in a
  generated article is a defect.
- **Sense inflation is a regression, not a win.** If grounding causes more senses to be shown, that
  is the failure mode to watch for, not the success metric.
- **The narrow real risk remains.** The literature's finding — that models silently drop senses —
  still holds, but only matters when a *common* sense goes missing. That is the thing worth
  measuring: not recall over 37, but whether the top three to five are the right three to five.

### What that means for the grounding spike, when it eventually runs

The metric is not recall. It is: does the grounded variant change the senses that get *shown*, and
are the changes improvements? With a hard negative check on sense count. This is a materially
smaller and more honest question than the one §09 implies, and it is a reason the spike can wait.

### Related, and deliberately noted here

The same "condense, don't enumerate" instinct points at where generated imagery is worth investing:
**images per sense and per example sentence, not per headword.** A sentence already carries the
action and the context, so the image prompt has something to draw; a bare headword usually does not,
and for concrete nouns the emoji already in the model does the job. This belongs in design §09's
`imagePrompt` staging rather than here, but it came out of the same reasoning and should not be lost.

## §2 · English (`en → en`, `en → ru`)

### Downloadable

| Source | Direction | Size / count | Licence | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Wiktextract / kaikki.org** | en→en (+ translations to ~everything) | English: **1,780,480 senses**, ~1.35 M entries, **2.69 GB** as JSONL. (The widely-quoted 22.9 GB / 2.6 GB gz figure is the **all-languages** raw dump extracted from the English Wiktionary — hundreds of languages, not English alone.) | CC BY-SA 4.0 + GFDL | **Core.** Richest structure available anywhere: senses, tags, categories, IPA, forms, etymology, translations, examples. |

### Online APIs

Rate limits deserve less anxiety than they usually get. Realistic personal use is a handful of
lookups a day; every free tier below is two to three orders of magnitude above that. Limits only
become a design input if a dictionary panel starts prefetching, which it should not.

| API | Coverage | Free tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **freedictionaryapi.com** | Multilingual, Wiktionary-backed, "8.5 M+ words" | **No key, 1,000 req/hour/IP** | **Start here.** Wiktionary-shaped, so it shares a field mapper with the offline kaikki files. Attribution required. Not self-hostable. |
| **Wikimedia REST** `…/api/rest_v1/page/definition/{term}` | All Wiktionary editions | 500 req/h unauthenticated, 5,000 authed; User-Agent required | **The fallback.** Official, and same upstream data — same mapper again. |
| **dictionaryapi.dev** | English only | No key, no published limit | Still up as of 2026. Community-run, no SLA. |
| **Wordnik** | AHD, Century, Wiktionary, GCIDE, WordNet — 800 k+ words | Generous free tier | Several dictionaries behind one call. Needs its own connector. |
| **WordsAPI** | English | 2,500 req/day, then $0.004/req | Ample for personal use. Thin content, own connector. |
| **Merriam-Webster** | Collegiate, Learner's, Spanish-English, Medical | 1,000 queries/day/key, **non-commercial**, max 2 reference APIs | High editorial quality. Commercial use requires a deal. |
| **Lexicala** (K Dictionaries) | 50 languages, 100 domains | Commercial only | One vendor covering en/es/zh/ru with real sense structure, if the free sources ever prove insufficient. |
| Glosbe public API | — | **Deprecated** | Do not build on it. |

### What the data looks like

Note how close the first one already is to Acervo's own article model — that similarity is the whole
basis of the tiering in §7.

## §3 · Spanish (`es → es`, `es → en`, `es → ru`)

| Source | Direction | Size / count | Licence | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **kaikki `eswiktionary`** | **es→es** | **1,035,866 Spanish senses**, definitions in Spanish | CC BY-SA 4.0 | **Core.** The monolingual answer, larger than the English edition's Spanish coverage. Also the source of the 37-sense `picar` entry in §1. |
| **kaikki**, English edition | es→en | **874,006 senses** | CC BY-SA 4.0 | **Core.** Best es→en structured data. Rich tags, dialect labels (`Mexican Spanish`), domains. |

### The honest `es → ru` finding

There is no good open Spanish→Russian dictionary. The options are WikDict pairs, PanLex pairs
(CC0), or pivoting es→en→ru and compounding the error. **Use dictionaries for `es→es` and `es→en`,
and keep letting the LLM write the Russian gloss.** (§11.3 confirms both directions map cleanly —
95.0 % and 97.5 % of entries — with nothing invented.) That is a genuine strength of the current
pipeline, not a gap, and it is a reason not to over-invest in bilingual dictionary plumbing.

## §4 · Chinese Mandarin (`zh → zh`, `zh → en`, `zh → ru`)

Subsystem deferred per §07; the schema (`reading`, traditional↔simplified as a variant axis) already
anticipates what these sources need.

## §5 · German, French, Japanese — a representative sample

Chosen to span the real range rather than the popular one: **German** has the best open bilingual
data of any pair; **French** has superb institutional dictionaries, none redistributable;
**Japanese** has the best-licensed open dictionary project anywhere plus a non-Latin script.

### German — the well-supplied case

| Source | Direction | Size / count | Licence | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **FreeDict `deu-eng` / `eng-deu`** (from Ding) | de↔en | **517,534 / 460,315 headwords** | GPL-ish | The **largest open bilingual pair in existence**. Nothing else comes close. |

| **dict.cc** | de↔en | 1.3 M+ entries, 1.5 M+ audio | **Proprietary since 2005** (was GPL) | Redistribution restricted. Link out only. |

### French — the locked-up case

| Source | Direction | Size / count | Licence | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **kaikki**, English edition / `frwiktionary` | fr→en / fr→fr | 458,908 senses; fr edition **6.3 GB** (681.5 MB gz — largest non-English edition) | CC BY-SA 4.0 | The only large open French resource in both directions. |
| **TLFi** (ATILF/CNRS) | fr→fr | 100 k words · **270 k definitions · 430 k examples** | Free to consult, **not redistributable** | The best French dictionary in existence. Link out to CNRTL. |
| **Dictionnaire de l'Académie française**, 9th ed. | fr→fr | Completed Nov 2024, fully online with the 4th and 8th editions | Consultation only | Prestige reference; link out. |

| **FreeDict `fra-eng` / `eng-fra`** | fr↔en | **8,505 / 8,799 headwords** | GPL-ish | Effectively unusable. |

France is the clear case where the good dictionaries are not licensable and the licensable one is
Wiktionary. Plan accordingly.

### Japanese — the well-run case

| Source | Direction | Size / count | Licence | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **JMdict** (EDRDG) | ja→en/fr/de | ~100,000 entries; "New Generation" distribution began May 2026 | **CC BY-SA 3.0** | The model for what an open dictionary project should be: versioned XML, sense-tagged, POS-tagged, priority-flagged, maintained for thirty years. `jmdict-simplified` publishes clean JSON. |

## §6 · Every other language — six hubs, not two hundred dictionaries

No language needs individual research. Six hubs cover essentially all of them; everything else is a
link-out.

| Hub | What it gives | Coverage | Licence | Shape |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **kaikki.org / wiktextract** | Full structured entries: senses, tags, domains, IPA, inflected forms, examples, translations | **~20 Wiktionary editions** extracted (en, zh, nl, fr, el, de, id, it, ja, ko, ku, ms, ru, pl, pt, es, th, tr …); the English edition alone covers hundreds of languages | CC BY-SA 4.0 + GFDL | JSONL |
| **DBnary → WikDict** | Bilingual translation pairs, cleaned and cross-checked | 26 languages, **17.7 M translations** | CC BY-SA 4.0 | RDF (OntoLex-Lemon) → StarDict / SQLite / TEI P5 / Kobo |
| **FreeDict** | Curated bilingual dictionaries, some very large | ~150 dictionaries, rebuilt through 2025-11 | GPL-ish, per-dictionary | TEI P5 → dictd / StarDict / slob |
| **PanLex** | Bare translation pairs, panlingual | **~9,000 language varieties**, 20 M lexemes, **1.1 B pairs** | **CC0** | CSV / JSON monthly snapshots + `api.panlex.org` |
| **Open Multilingual Wordnet** | Sense graphs linked through the English ILI | 60 wordnets / 49 languages + auto-extracted for 150+ | Apache-2.0 packaging; per-wordnet licences vary | LMF / GWA XML; Python `wn` |
| **Tatoeba** | Human sentence pairs, for examples rather than definitions | **13.4 M sentences / 429 languages** | CC BY 2.0 FR, some CC0 | TSV |

Plus one **pre-built** channel: the Yomitan ecosystem (`kaikki-to-yomitan` →
`wiktionary-to-yomitan`) publishes ready-made zips for 100+ languages at
`huggingface.co/datasets/daxida/wty-release` — **2.32 GB** for the whole `latest/dict` set,
CC BY-SA 4.0, a German→English dictionary being ~21 MB. The fastest route to a per-language
artifact without running wiktextract over a 6 GB dump.

## §7 · Formats, and what Acervo should actually store

### Separate the content model from the container

The first draft of this section proposed one canonical relational schema with an adapter per source.
Two objections to that are correct and change the design:

1. **A bespoke schema per source is an unbounded maintenance surface.** Anyone reusing the project
   who wants a dictionary Acervo has not mapped must either extend the compiler or go without, and
   each new source invites its own corner cases.
2. **Relational normalisation is the wrong shape for something read whole.** A dictionary entry is
   always fetched entirely, by key, and rendered. Splitting it across five tables buys query
   flexibility nobody needs and pays for it in rows, indexes and bytes.

But the container requirement does not go away: a 2.69 GB JSONL file cannot be scanned per keystroke
on a phone, so *something* must provide keyed random access and prefix search.

> ### DECISION — SUPERSEDED by §11
> *Measured and rejected. SQLite costs 1.66× the packed-blob container for the same corpus; the
> replacement decision is in §11. The two-tier payload idea survives, but not its rationale — HTML
> turned out to be **smaller** than the mapped fields, not larger. Kept here because §11 is only
> legible as a correction to it.*
>
> **SQLite as a dumb container, not as a relational model. Two tiers of payload.**
>
> ```
> meta(key, value)                           -- name, source, licence, attribution, built_at
> entry(headword, lemma, tier, payload)      -- payload: compressed bytes
> index on headword, index on lemma
> ```
>
> `tier` is `fields` (the source's own structured JSON, lightly normalised) or `html` (a rendered
> fragment). **There is no per-source relational schema at all.**
>
> **Because** this removes the maintenance surface — adding a source becomes "can PyGlossary read
> it? then it is `html`" — while keeping the keyed access a phone needs. SQLite is the cheapest such
> container: it is in the Python standard library, ships to the browser as `sqlite-wasm`, and is one
> file to download and delete.
>
> **This also means** SQLite is not the bloat risk it appears to be. Column names are stored once in
> the schema, whereas JSONL repeats every key on every one of 1.35 M records — key repetition alone
> is a large share of that 2.69 GB. The genuine bloat risks are elsewhere and are avoidable: FTS5
> indexes can rival the size of the text they index, so full-text search stays **optional per
> dictionary** (headword and lemma B-trees are small), and payloads are compressed **per row** so
> one entry can be decompressed without touching the rest. A zstd dictionary trained on a sample
> recovers most of the cross-row redundancy that per-row compression gives up.

Alternatives considered:

| Approach | Why not |
|---|---|
| Raw JSONL plus a sidecar offset index | Works, but the index is hand-rolled, there is no prefix search, and every platform needs its own byte-range reader. SQLite provides all three. |
| Yomitan zip imported into IndexedDB | Requires unpacking row-by-row before first use, and puts dictionary bulk in the same store as the replica, which §04 keeps precious. |
| Whole-file gzip of JSONL | No random access. Decompressing 2.69 GB to answer one lookup. |
| `sql.js-httpvfs` over HTTP Range | Not an alternative — **keep it** for the online path, where it serves a server-side file without a lookup route. |

### Which formats map to Acervo's model, and which do not

**Tier 1 — `fields`.** Field-structured at the source, so one mapper produces something the existing
article components can render. These are worth the mapping effort.

| Format | Mapper effort | Why it maps |
|---|---|---|
| **wiktextract JSONL** | One mapper, reused everywhere | Near-isomorphic to Acervo's model already: `word`, `pos`, `sounds[].ipa`, `senses[].glosses`, `senses[].tags`, `forms[]`. This is the mapper that matters — it covers ~20 Wiktionary editions and hundreds of languages. |
| **Wiktionary-shaped JSON APIs** (freedictionaryapi.com, Wikimedia REST) | ~~Shares the above~~ **one small connector each** | Same upstream data but *three different field shapes* — measured in §11.5, which withdraws this claim. |
| **CC-CEDICT** | ~30 lines | Fixed line grammar: traditional, simplified, `[pinyin]`, `/gloss/gloss/`. |
| **jmdict-simplified JSON** | Small | Sense-tagged, POS-tagged JSON. |
| **ECDICT CSV** | Small | Columnar, with frequency and exam metadata worth keeping. |
| **Yomitan zip** | Medium (~60 lines) | Its structured content is a tree of typed nodes — cheap to walk, and cheap to render straight to HTML if mapping proves fiddly. |

**Tier 2 — `html`.** The payload is an opaque text or HTML blob at the source, so there is nothing to
map. PyGlossary reads all of these; convert to HTML, sanitise, and display it in a styled container
with Acervo's fonts and spacing.

StarDict · slob (Aard2) · MDict `.mdx` · ABBYY DSL · dictd · Babylon BGL · Lingoes · Zim ·
XDXF · TEI P5.

XDXF and TEI P5 are genuinely semantically marked up and *could* be mapped, but adoption is thin
enough that HTML is the right call until a specific dictionary justifies otherwise.

**Tier 3 — link out.** No redistributable file and no API: RAE / DLE, TLFi, Dictionnaire de
l'Académie française, dict.cc, Pleco, Linguee, SpanishDict. These get a link in the UI and nothing
else.

### The online-API gap

The format tiering above is clean for files because **PyGlossary is a universal reader**. There is no
equivalent for APIs: every one needs a hand-written connector, and that is precisely the kind of
per-source maintenance the tiering exists to avoid.

The mitigation is to exploit shared upstreams rather than write many connectors:

- **freedictionaryapi.com and Wikimedia REST are both Wiktionary-derived**, so ship these two and
  stop: one primary, one fallback. But *not* "zero new mapping logic" — §11.5 measured three
  different field shapes across the three Wiktionary-derived sources. Budget ~40 lines each.
- Wordnik, WordsAPI, Merriam-Webster and Lexicala each need a bespoke connector. Add one only when a
  concrete gap in the free sources appears — not speculatively.
- Rate limits are not a constraint at personal scale (§2). Do not prefetch; look up on demand.

### Sizes — measure, do not assert

An earlier draft listed estimates (≈150–250 MB for kaikki English, ≈120–200 MB for Spanish). Those
were guesses and they look implausibly small next to the 2.69 GB source, so they are removed. The
reasoning behind them, stated so it can be falsified by the spike:

1. Stripping wiktextract to display fields drops categories, etymology templates, `head_templates`,
   wikitext residue and sense ids — guessed at 85–90 % of the bytes.
2. Per-row compression of what remains — guessed at roughly half again.
3. 2.69 GB → ~300 MB → ~150 MB.

Any link in that chain could be wrong by 2× or more, in either direction. §10's spike measured it
instead: **37–40 MiB** for the whole Spanish Wiktionary (838,769 headwords), so the guess was about
4× too high. See §11.1.

---

## §8 · PWA storage limits

**A non-issue at plausible sizes; a real constraint only past ~1 GB.**

| Platform | Per origin | Overall | Eviction |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Chrome / Edge / Chrome Android** | up to **60 % of total disk** | 80 % of disk | LRU under storage pressure; best-effort origins only |
| **Safari / WebKit browser tab**, iOS 17+ & macOS 14+ | up to **60 % of total disk** (WebKit's own figure; MDN and some secondary sources report ~20 % for tabs) | 80 % | LRU plus the 7-day rule |
| **Safari Home Screen / Dock web app** (installed PWA) | same as a browser app | 80 % | Has its **own days-of-use counter**, separate from Safari's |
| **Embedded WebKit** (WKWebView in `macos/`) | **15 % of total disk** | **20 %** | Same policy |
| **Firefox** | best-effort `min(10 % of disk, 10 GiB)` per site group; **persistent up to 50 %** | — | LRU |
| `localStorage`, everywhere | **5 MiB** | — | — |

Consequences for Acervo:

1. **The pre-iOS-17 1 GB cap is gone.** Since iOS 17 / macOS Sonoma the quota is computed from disk
   size with no user prompt. Advice that iOS PWAs get 50 MB is obsolete.
2. **Call `navigator.storage.persist()` once** after a dictionary is installed. Persistent-mode
   origins are exempt from eviction entirely. Chrome and Safari decide silently from engagement
   history; Firefox prompts. The single most important line of code in the feature.
3. **The 7-day rule is the real risk, not the quota.** An origin with no user interaction in the last
   seven days of browser use has its script-written storage deleted. An installed Home Screen web app
   counts its own days of use, so a weekly habit is safe — but `persist()` is what makes it certain.
4. **`macos/` is the tightest target, not iOS.** WKWebView is a "non-browser app": 15 % per origin,
   20 % overall. On a 256 GB Mac that is still ~38 GB.
5. **Measure, never assume.** `navigator.storage.estimate()` returns `{usage, quota}` and belongs in
   the Dictionaries settings pane before an install. Sources disagree about Safari's tab-origin
   percentage, and values are padded against fingerprinting.
6. **Guard `QuotaExceededError`** and fail the install cleanly, leaving already-installed dictionaries
   untouched — the "fail loudly, change nothing" discipline of §04.

Storage headroom is therefore *not* the binding constraint; **download size and install time are**.
A 150 MB download over a phone connection is the thing a person actually notices, which is another
reason §7's compactness work matters and §10's spike measures it.

## §9 · Licensing — Acervo ships a catalogue, not dictionaries

The share-alike analysis in the first draft assumed Acervo would distribute dictionary data. It will
not, and that changes the obligation substantially.

> ### DECISION
> **Ship a catalogue of pointers. The user chooses what to install, and the download happens between
> them and the source.**

A tracked `dictionaries/catalogue.json` lists what is available — id, display name, languages and
direction, tier (`fields` / `html` / `link`), source URL, format, licence, approximate bytes, notes.
The application reads it, offers the list per vocabulary, and installs on request. Acervo distributes
the *list*, which is a set of facts and URLs.

What remains a real obligation, and is cheap:

- **Show attribution and licence wherever an external entry is rendered.** This is what CC BY-SA asks
  of anyone displaying the content, distributor or not, and the `meta` table already carries it.
- **Honour API terms**: User-Agent on Wikimedia, no prefetch storms, no circumventing rate limits.
- **Do not ship a scraper.** RAE and friends stay Tier 3 link-outs regardless of how good they are.
- **Keep unclear provenance out of the default catalogue.** BKRS is the case in point: excellent
  zh→ru content, murkiest licensing here. Someone can add it themselves; Acervo should not suggest it.

Licence classification, kept for catalogue metadata rather than as a compliance exercise:

| Licence | Sources |
|---|---|
| **CC0** | PanLex |
| **MIT** | ECDICT |
| **CC BY 4.0** (no share-alike) | Open English WordNet |
| **CC BY 3.0** | MCR non-English wordnets |
| **CC BY-SA 3.0 / 4.0** | Wiktionary/kaikki, CC-CEDICT, JMdict/KANJIDIC/JMnedict, WikDict/DBnary, CC-Canto |
| **GPL** | Mueller, most FreeDict |
| **Proprietary / unclear** | RAE DLE, dict.cc, TLFi, Académie française, Collins, Oxford, Merriam-Webster content, BKRS, most MDict and DSL files |

**Catalogue maintenance.** Start with only the languages in use — `es` and `en` — and grow on demand.
A monthly script that HEADs every catalogue URL and reports what moved or died is enough; it is a
cron-able check, not a service.

## §10 · Build order

### Spike 0 — measure, then choose

**Before any application code.** The open questions are all empirical, and §7's decision is stated
with enough specificity to be wrong. Scope this narrowly: a throwaway script under `scripts/`, a
table of numbers, and a go/no-go.

**Inputs, cheapest first**

| Input | Why this one |
|---|---|
| **CC-CEDICT** (~9.5 MB) | The control. Trivial grammar, small, Tier 1 — if the path does not work here it works nowhere. |
| **kaikki `eswiktionary`** | The real case: Spanish is the language actually in use, and it is the 37-sense `picar` source. Big enough for the size question to mean something. |
| **One Tier 2 dictionary** — FreeDict `eng-rus` as StarDict or slob | Proves the PyGlossary → HTML path and gives the `html` tier a real byte count. |
| **freedictionaryapi.com**, ~20 headwords | Proves the online path and, critically, whether the *same* Tier 1 mapper serves it. |

**What to measure**

1. **Bytes at each stage** for both Tier 1 inputs: source → stripped fields → SQLite with per-row
   gzip → per-row zstd → zstd with a trained dictionary → each of those again with and without FTS5.
   This settles whether the ~150 MB guess in §7 was anywhere near right.
2. **Lookup latency** for exact headword, lemma, and prefix search, on the largest artifact.
3. **Render fidelity**: does the mapped `fields` payload actually satisfy the existing `Article` view
   model, and which fields have no home? Enumerate the drops rather than guessing.
4. **PyGlossary in practice**: does it read the chosen Tier 2 file without hand-holding, how big is
   the HTML, and does the output need sanitising before display?
5. **Mapper reuse**: one function mapping both kaikki JSONL and the API response, or two?

**Deliverable.** A short results section appended to this document with real numbers, plus a decision
on the container. If SQLite loses on size to something simpler, say so and take the simpler thing —
the decision in §7 is a hypothesis, not a commitment.

### Then, in order

- **Stage 1 · the catalogue and the compiler. Built.** `dictionaries/catalogue.json` (58 rows across
  a dozen languages) and `scripts/build_dictionary.py` over `src/acervo/dictionaries/`, reduced to
  what the spike proved: one converter for the wiktextract shape, four small ones for the other
  field-structured formats, and PyGlossary for everything opaque. No per-source schemas.
  [`features/dictionaries.md`](../features/dictionaries.md) records what was built.
- **Stage 2 · the reader and the server route. Built, and the route turned out to be unnecessary.**
  `web/src/dictionary.ts` is the reader — `lookup` / `search` over a `ByteSource`, with
  `web/src/dictionaries.ts` owning the transports and the resolution order, mirroring how `sync.ts`
  owns the graph transport. A *lookup* route was planned; it is not needed, because the artifact is
  served as a static file that answers byte ranges, so "this device, then the server" is the same
  reader over a different byte source rather than the format implemented twice. What the server does
  have is a listing route, an authenticated static route, and the two online connectors. No
  collections, no records, no revisions, no sync.
- **Stage 3 · the interface. Built.** Settings has a Dictionaries pane with size, licence,
  install/remove, `storage.estimate()` and the `persist()` request. The reading surfaces are now
  there too: an "Other dictionaries" section in search below a separator, which becomes the answer
  when no word of yours matches; a read-only fold at the foot of `LexemeArticle.tsx` that looks the
  headword up only when opened; and "Add to my words" on a dictionary entry. §12 records what was
  built and the three findings that changed the plan.
- **Stage 4 · grounding.** Postponed indefinitely, gated on
  [grounding-spike.md](../plans/grounding-spike.md), and re-scoped by §1: the question is
  whether the *shown* senses improve, not whether coverage increases.

### The interface may flex to fit the data

Two accommodations are explicitly acceptable rather than compromises, and they are what make the
tiering affordable:

- **Render an `html` payload as HTML** — sanitised, in Acervo's fonts and spacing, without pretending
  it is a structured entry.
- **Drop source fields that have no home** in the article view rather than growing the view model to
  accommodate every dictionary. External entries are a reference surface, not a second data model.

### Explicitly out of scope

The Chinese subsystem (§07); any scraper; bundling BKRS or anything else of unclear provenance;
per-entry caching of dictionary data; bespoke connectors for APIs beyond the two Wiktionary-shaped
ones; and anything that puts a dictionary row in PocketBase.

## Verification

```bash
# Spike 0 — the control case first
.venv/bin/python scripts/spike_dictionary_sizes.py --source cc-cedict --in cedict_ts.u8
#   reports: source bytes, stripped bytes, sqlite+gzip, sqlite+zstd, +/- FTS5, lookup ms

# then the real case
.venv/bin/python scripts/spike_dictionary_sizes.py --source wiktextract-es --in es-extract.jsonl

# the Tier 2 path
pyglossary --read-format=Stardict --write-format=Html eng-rus.ifo eng-rus.html

# the online path, same mapper
.venv/bin/python scripts/spike_dictionary_sizes.py --source freedictionaryapi \
  --words picar,desmayarse,balsa --compare-mapper wiktextract-es

# Stage 2 onward — the invariant that matters
npm --prefix web run test && .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/server
npm --prefix web run build && npm run test:pwa
#  · install a dictionary, then stop the server → lookup and search must still work
#  · no dictionary installed and the server down → the section reports unavailable,
#    the local list is unaffected, nothing is written
#  · DevTools → Application → Storage: confirm persisted=true and usage after install
```

## §11 · Spike 0 results

**Status:** measured. Apparatus and raw numbers in
[`experiments/external-dictionaries/`](../../experiments/external-dictionaries). Everything below is
measured on the real corpora unless labelled an estimate.

Corpora: CC-CEDICT (2026-08-31), kaikki `eswiktionary` and kaikki Spanish (English edition),
jmdict-simplified 3.6.2, FreeDict `eng-rus` 2025.11.23 in both TEI P5 and StarDict form, plus
freedictionaryapi and the Wikimedia REST definition endpoint. Sources were chosen to span *formats*
— fixed line grammar, rich JSONL, clean sense-tagged JSON, semantic XML, opaque binary, JSON API —
rather than languages.

### The five headline findings

1. **Uncompressed, the `fields` tier is larger than HTML; compressed, the difference nearly
   vanishes.** Raw, HTML costs 0.70× the mapped JSON. But the JSON is larger *because* it repeats
   `definitionLang` and `order` on every sense, and repetition is exactly what a compressor
   removes — so once payloads are block-compressed the ratio moves to **0.93×**. Mapping costs
   about **7 %**, not 30 %. Neither tier should be chosen on size; §11.0a has the numbers.
2. **Latency is not a constraint and never becomes one.** Exact lookup p95 is 0.01–0.25 ms across
   every container at every scale tested. The stated tolerance was ~1 s. Size can decide alone.
3. **§7's ~150 MB guess was about 4× too high.** The whole Spanish Wiktionary — 838,769 headwords —
   lands at **37–40 MiB** installed. Storage is a non-issue at this size; §8's conclusion is
   reinforced, not merely preserved.
4. **The headword index, not the payload, is now the thing worth optimising.** At full scale the
   index is 19.5 MiB against a 17–20 MiB compressed payload — half the artifact. Front-coding the sorted keys and
   varint-packing the records takes it to **5.7 MiB** — a ~40 % cut to the whole artifact, and by
   some distance the highest-leverage work remaining.
5. **The only thing that ever blocked a mapping was Acervo's part-of-speech enum.** Not one source
   format defeated the mapper. Carrying the source's own label as free text on a render-only entry
   took every source to 98.7–100 % with nothing invented (§11.3), online sources included.

> ### DECISION — supersedes the container decision in §7
> **A packed blob plus a sidecar index, block-compressed at 256 entries, read with `fflate`.
> Not SQLite.**
>
> ```
> <name>.dict   concatenated payloads, deflate-compressed in 256-entry frames
> <name>.idx    sorted headwords + one fixed record per entry (front-coded — see below)
> <name>.json   meta: name, source, licence, attribution, built_at
> ```
>
> **Because** it is the smallest total on the device and the fewest moving parts at once. SQLite
> costs **1.53× more** than the recommended packed build for the same corpus (60.9 MiB against
> 39.7 MiB, and 1.67× against the smallest packed build at 36.5 MiB): a
> 1.3 MB wasm engine, plus page-alignment overhead on every row. `fflate` is already a `web/`
> dependency, is ~8 KB, and supports the shared-dictionary API in both directions, so the read path
> ships no new engine at all. A lookup is one binary search and one 256-entry frame decode — about
> 50 KiB transient, which is the memory budget a phone actually cares about.
>
> **One container serves both mobile and the server.** The server has no space problem and could
> use anything, but the same file read by the same code is worth more than a second format that
> saves nothing anyone is short of. `sql.js-httpvfs` is no longer needed for the online path either
> — an HTTP Range read of the packed blob is the same operation.

### §11.0 · What the two payload tiers actually look like

`picar` — the 37-sense entry from §1 — as the spike stores it. The `fields` payload is compact
JSON; YAML is what a person would read and lands within 3 % of it, so the byte columns elsewhere
carry over to either.

```html
<!-- html tier -->
<h1>picar</h1><p class=ipa>[piˈkaɾ]</p><h2>verb</h2>
<ol><li>Golpear algo con una punta, agujereándolo o no.</li>
    <li>Cortar en pedazos muy pequeños.</li>
    <li>Irritar o provocar a alguien.</li> …</ol>
```

```json
// fields tier — the same entry, as the ArticleDraft shape
{"language":"es","headword":"picar","lemma":"picar","pos":"verb","posLabel":"verb",
 "status":"inbox","senses":[
   {"order":0,"definition":"Golpear algo con una punta, agujereándolo o no.","definitionLang":"es"},
   {"order":1,"definition":"Cortar en pedazos muy pequeños.","definitionLang":"es"}, …]}
```

| `picar` | raw | deflate alone |
|---|---:|---:|
| html | 2,226 | 1,069 |
| fields (JSON) | 3,820 | 1,268 |
| fields (YAML) | 3,700 | 1,262 |

### §11.0a · How the compression works, and why grouping matters

Payloads are compressed with **DEFLATE** — the LZ77 + Huffman scheme behind gzip and zip. It is
chosen for reach rather than ratio: browsers implement it natively in `DecompressionStream`, and
`fflate` (already a `web/` dependency, ~8 KB) implements it in JavaScript, so the read path ships
nothing new.

Articles are **not compressed individually**. They are concatenated in document order and
compressed in **frames of 256 entries**; a lookup decodes one frame and slices out the entry it
wants. Measured over 19,924 Spanish entries:

| | fields | html | html ÷ fields |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| raw | 10,717,209 | 7,450,516 | 0.70× |
| deflate, per entry | 6,060,045 | 4,959,994 | 0.82× |
| deflate, frames of 16 | 3,209,665 | 3,000,887 | 0.93× |
| deflate, frames of 64 | 2,797,886 | 2,647,075 | 0.95× |
| **deflate, frames of 256** | **2,597,521** | **2,422,113** | **0.93×** |
| deflate, frames of 1024 | 2,539,268 | 2,348,352 | 0.92× |

Two things follow. **Grouping is worth 57 %** — frames of 256 against compressing each article
alone. And **the tier gap is a compression artefact**: `fields` compresses to 24 % of its raw size
against HTML's 33 %, precisely because the repeated keys are redundant, so most of HTML's apparent
advantage disappears. Frames of 1024 save a further 2 % but quadruple the memory a single lookup
allocates, which is the wrong trade on a phone; 256 is the pick.

### §11.1 · Container — full corpus, kaikki `eswiktionary`, 838,769 headwords

`fields` payload, 251.7 MiB raw, 99.5 % of headwords mapped. "Total device" is artifact + trained
dictionary + the library a client must ship to read it.

| Container | Codec | Blob | Index | Library | **Total device** | vs best | RAM/lookup | p50 | p95 |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| packed+block256 | zstd19+dict | 16.6 | 19.5 | 340 KiB | **36.5 MiB** | 1.00× | 65 KiB | 0.15 | 0.23 |
| packed+block256 | zstd19 | 18.7 | 19.5 | 8 KiB | **38.2 MiB** | 1.05× | 65 KiB | 0.13 | 0.23 |
| packed+block256 | deflate+dict | 19.1 | 19.5 | — | **38.7 MiB** | 1.06× | 65 KiB | 0.15 | 0.29 |
| **packed+block256** | **deflate** | **20.2** | **19.5** | **—** | **39.7 MiB** | **1.09×** | **65 KiB** | **0.19** | **4.95**\* |
| sqlite+block256 | deflate | 59.6 | — | 1,275 KiB | **60.9 MiB** | 1.67× | 169 KiB | 0.04 | 0.12 |

\* The `deflate` p95 is a cold-read artifact, not an algorithmic cost: it is the first artifact
built in the sweep, so its pages are the ones the OS has evicted by benchmark time. Its p50 (0.19 ms)
sits with every other candidate, and even the outlier is 200× inside the ~1 s budget.

**Plain `deflate` is the recommendation despite not winning.** It is 9 % larger than the best
result and needs no library beyond what is already bundled. zstd-with-a-trained-dictionary saves
3.2 MiB but costs a ~340 KB wasm build, because `fzstd` (the 8 KB pure-JS decoder) cannot supply a
custom dictionary — so the real comparison is 36.5 against 39.7 MiB, and 3.2 MiB does not justify a
second compression engine on the read path. Revisit only if many dictionaries are installed at once,
where the library cost amortises and the payload saving does not.

Block size matters more than codec choice: 256-entry frames roughly halve per-row compression, and
once blocked, `deflate` and `zstd19` are within 8 % of each other. Brotli-11 was measured and
discarded — never competitive after its engine cost, and the Python binding exposes no
custom-dictionary API at all, so that variant is impractical by construction.

### §11.2 · The index is the remaining prize — built, and the numbers held

| Index | Bytes | Note |
|---|---:|---|
| As built in the spike (sorted keys + one packed record each) | 19.5 MiB | keys 8.4 + fixed records ~11 |
| Front-coded keys | 2.5 MiB | 29 % of raw — sorted headwords share long prefixes |
| Varint records | 3.2 MiB | with a fixed block size the block number is `index // 256` |
| Both applied, predicted | 5.7 MiB | saves ~13.8 MiB, ~35 % of the artifact |
| **Both applied, as Stage 1 actually built it** | **8.1 MiB** | see below |

**Stage 1 built this and the artifact came in at 27.8 MiB against the 39.7 MiB measured above — a
30 % cut.** The whole Spanish Wiktionary is 834,245 entries and 865,202 lookup keys in 19.7 MiB of
payloads plus 8.1 MiB of index, built in about 30 seconds and byte-identical on a rebuild.

The index landed above the 5.7 MiB prediction for two reasons, both deliberate. Every key carries a
varint *entry index* rather than being positional, which is what makes an alias free — the
traditional spelling of a simplified headword, and a case-folded spelling of an accented one, point
at an existing entry and cost nothing but a key. That is 865,202 keys rather than 834,245. And the
prediction ignored the two things a reader needs to use a front-coded index at all:

- **Restart points.** Front-coding destroys random access, which a binary search requires. Every
  16th key is stored whole with its offset recorded, so a lookup binary-searches the restart table
  and then scans one bucket of at most 16. Costs about 6 % of the key bytes.
- **A per-frame offset into the payload-length section.** Without it, finding an entry's offset
  inside its frame means holding every entry's length — about 2 MiB for this corpus, per dictionary,
  which does not survive the ten-dictionaries-per-language the interface is built for. With it, a
  lookup range-reads at most 256 varints.

What stays resident per open dictionary is therefore the header, the frame table and the restart
table. Measured on the finished artifact with the real reader: **499 KiB resident**, 210 KiB read to
open the dictionary at all, and **12.6 KiB read to answer one lookup** — a binary search over ~16
restart probes, one bucket, one run of payload lengths and one frame. Ten dictionaries open at once
therefore cost about 5 MiB, which is the budget the interface's ten-per-language target needs.

One further detail that is not a size question but was found while building this: **the keys must be
ordered by their UTF-8 bytes**, not by locale collation and not by the platform's own string
comparison. JavaScript compares UTF-16 code units, which disagrees with UTF-8 byte order above the
BMP, so a reader searching one order over an index built in the other fails to find real entries —
and fails only for the rarest characters, which is the kind of bug that survives casual testing.

### §11.3 · Representation — is the mapper worth writing?

5,000-entry samples. "Mapped" is the share of source entries that produce a renderable entry.

| Source | Format family | fields MiB | html MiB | Mapped | Dropped fields | Mapper | Verdict |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `cc-cedict` | fixed line grammar | 1.3 | 0.7 | 100.0 % | 1 | ~30 lines | **map** |
| `jmdict-eng` | sense-tagged JSON | 1.4 | 0.5 | 100.0 % | 6 | ~45 lines | **map** |
| `freedict-eng-rus-tei` | semantic XML | 1.0 | 0.4 | 100.0 % | 0 | ~35 lines | **map** |
| `kaikki-es-en` | rich JSONL | 1.6 | 1.2 | 100.0 % | 29 | ~90 lines | **map** |
| `kaikki-es-es` | rich JSONL | 2.8 | 2.1 | 98.7 % | 15 | same mapper | **map** |
| `freedict-eng-rus-stardict` | opaque binary | — | 1.8 | — | all | — | **html only** |

**Every mapped entry is a valid article**: run through the application's own `parseArticle` — not a
re-implementation — acceptance is **100 % on all seven sources**, offline and online. Nothing is
invented in any mapper. The residual 1.3 % on `es→es` is entries carrying no usable gloss text at
all, not a mapping failure.

#### Part of speech: keep the source's word, never invent one

An earlier draft of this section reported 95–98 % coverage and a `pos: noun` invented for
CC-CEDICT. Both were artefacts of forcing every source into Acervo's closed seven-value enum, and
the fix changes the numbers above.

The enum is `noun verb adj adv phrase idiom expression`. Real sources carry far more:
`conj`, `prep`, `pron`, `det`, `num`, `particle`, `article`, `character`, `prefix`, `suffix`,
`contraction`, `abbrev` from wiktextract; 17 further tags from jmdict; `pn`, `pronoun`, `prefix`,
`suffix` from TEI. **CC-CEDICT carries no part of speech at all.**

`parseArticle` handles this badly for a source it was never designed for. `reader.choice` (yaml.ts:588)
**silently substitutes `"noun"` when `pos` is missing**, and hard-fails when it is present but
outside the enum — so omitting the field does not avoid inventing a value, it only hides the
invention.

> ### DECISION
> **An external entry carries `pos` only when the source's own value genuinely maps, and always
> carries `posLabel` — the source's word, verbatim — which the interface displays as-is.**
>
> **Because** these entries are render-only and never reach the database, so nothing requires the
> enum here. A dictionary that says `preposition` should say `preposition` on screen; bucketing it
> into `expression` is a lie and dropping the entry is a worse one. Where a source says nothing —
> CC-CEDICT — the entry says nothing and the interface shows nothing.
>
> **This also means** external entries do **not** round-trip through `ArticleDraft` unchanged:
> `posLabel` is an unknown key that today's `parseArticle` would reject. The render-only view model
> takes a free-text part of speech; the enum stays exactly as it is for records that are stored.
> This is a Stage 3 decision and is deliberately not a widening of the stored schema.

Applying it took every source to 100 % except `es→es` at 98.7 %, and removed the only invented
field in the experiment.

### §11.4 · Tier 2, and PyGlossary in practice

The opaque-binary path works and produces usable HTML, confirming the fallback is real: 5,000
StarDict entries → 1.8 MiB of HTML, 0.3 MiB installed. Two practical frictions:

- **PyGlossary 5.4.2 renamed `Glossary.read` to `directRead`**, and silently disables seven plugins
  — including **XDXF** — when `lxml` is absent, printing a warning rather than failing. Anything
  depending on those formats must install `lxml` explicitly.
- **Its HTML needs restyling, not merely sanitising.** FreeDict StarDict payloads carry
  presentational markup — `<font color="gray">` for IPA, `<font class="grammar" color="green">` for
  part of speech — whose inline colours would fight Acervo's theme in both light and dark. Strip
  `<font>`, keep the structure, restyle from the class names where they exist.

Notably these payloads *do* contain IPA, part of speech, definition and translation as recoverable
structure. They could be mapped by parsing the HTML — and that is exactly the case where the answer
is no: extracting fields from presentational markup is unbounded maintenance for a source that
renders perfectly well as-is.

### §11.5 · Online sources

For an online source the question is not size — nothing is stored — but whether the response maps
safely. Measured over 27 Spanish headwords chosen to span parts of speech, including a multi-word
entry, an accented one, and one word no source holds.

| API | Requested | Absent at source | Transport failures | Held | Mapped | Mapped ÷ held | p50 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `freedictionaryapi` | 27 | 1 | 0 | 26 | 26 | **100.0 %** | 128 ms |
| `wikimedia-rest` | 27 | 1 | 0 | 26 | 26 | **100.0 %** | 46 ms |

**Both map every word they actually hold**, and `parseArticle` accepts all of them. The single
absence is the deliberate nonsense word, which both sources correctly report as having no entry —
freedictionaryapi as `200` with an empty `entries` list, Wikimedia as a `404`.

Two measurement bugs were found and fixed rather than reported as source limitations, which is
worth recording because both would have understated coverage:

- **A first run counted 4 "transport failures" on each API.** They were the same four words on
  both — `rápido`, `rápidamente`, `ojalá`, `de repente` — and the cause was a missing
  percent-encoding in the spike, not the APIs. Accented and multi-word headwords are ordinary here.
- **A first run reported 69 % coverage.** Every failure was the part-of-speech enum, nothing else;
  §11.3's decision took it to 100 %. Retries now distinguish a genuine 404 from a timeout, so an
  absent word is never scored as a mapping failure.

**§7's claim that these "share the offline wiktextract mapper" is wrong and is withdrawn.** Three
Wiktionary-derived sources, three field shapes: wiktextract has `pos`, `sounds[].ipa` and
`senses[].glosses` (a *list*); freedictionaryapi has `partOfSpeech`, `pronunciations[].text` and
`senses[].definition` (a *string*); Wikimedia REST returns definitions as **HTML fragments with
`mw:WikiLink` markup**, so mapping it means stripping markup, and its raw HTML is 2.4× the mapped
fields. Budget one small connector each, roughly 40 lines — not one shared mapper.

Two further practical notes. The definition endpoint exists **only on `en.wiktionary.org`**, keyed
by term with languages inside the response; a per-language host 404s on everything. And both APIs
return more senses than §1 wants shown — **4.2 and 4.6 per entry**, against a three-to-five target,
so they sit at the top of the range and a long entry still needs truncating.

### §11.6 · What this changes

- **§7's container DECISION is superseded** by §11's. SQLite was a reasonable hypothesis and it
  lost on measurement, at 1.66× the size for no benefit that matters here.
- **§7's "same mapper" claim about the APIs is withdrawn** (§11.5).
- **§7's removed ~150 MB estimate is replaced by 37–40 MiB measured** for the largest corpus.
- **The `fields`/`html` tiering survives, and size is not what decides it.** Block-compressed, the
  two tiers are within 7 % of each other (§11.0a), so the choice is about rendering, not bytes.
  Map where a source is already field-structured — every non-opaque format measured, at 30–90 lines
  each — and render HTML where it is not.
- **Acervo's part-of-speech enum does not survive contact with real dictionaries**, and external
  entries should carry the source's own label as free text (§11.3). This is the one place the spike
  changes an interface decision rather than a storage one.
- **Answering the question that motivated the spike:** yes, build the ingest path — but only the
  wiktextract mapper is load-bearing, since it covers ~20 Wiktionary editions and hundreds of
  languages. The small parsers are cheap enough to add on demand, and HTML remains the guaranteed
  fallback for everything opaque. Every source measured — offline and online — reaches 98.7–100 %
  coverage with nothing invented.

### §11.7 · The device probe — run, and what it settled

Run over https (mkcert + Caddy on the LAN) on macOS Safari, iPad Safari and Android Chrome. This was
the last open measurement; nothing here is inference any more.

| | macOS Safari | iPad Safari | Android Chrome |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DecompressionStream` gzip / deflate / deflate-raw | supported | supported | supported |
| `DecompressionStream` zstd / br | **not supported** | **not supported** | **not supported** |
| OPFS `getDirectory` | available | available | available |
| `createSyncAccessHandle` on the main thread | absent | absent | absent |
| `storage.estimate()` quota | 76.8 GiB | 38.4 GiB | 10.0 GiB |
| `fflate` inflate | 0.070 ms/frame | 0.045 ms/frame | 0.124 ms/frame |
| Store a 40 MiB Blob in IndexedDB | 102 ms | 129 ms | 165 ms |
| Bytes stored ÷ bytes written | *usage unreported* | *usage unreported* | **1.00×** |
| `Blob.slice(64 KiB)` out of 40 MiB, p50 | 0.00 ms | 0.00 ms | 1.40 ms |
| `Blob.slice(whole 40 MiB)` | 14 ms | 29 ms | 37 ms |

**The codec question is closed.** `zstd` is unsupported on every device and `deflate` is supported on
every one, so plain DEFLATE is not merely the cheapest option, it is the only one that ships no
engine. `fflate` decodes a frame in 0.045–0.124 ms against a ~1 s budget.

**IndexedDB preserves the compaction.** Android Chrome reports **1.00×** — storage grows by exactly
what was written, so already-compressed frames are stored as opaque bytes and nothing re-encodes
them. Both WebKit browsers report `usage` unchanged after a write that plainly happened, because
WebKit updates that figure lazily; the probe now says so rather than reporting a ratio of zero,
which it previously painted as a pass. This has one consequence in the interface: the Dictionaries
pane must not quote a usage figure lower than what it knows it is holding, and reports headroom
instead.

**Blob slices are lazy, which is the assumption the container rests on.** A 64 KiB range read out of
a 40 MiB stored Blob costs 0.00–1.40 ms while reading the whole Blob costs 14–37 ms. If a slice
materialised the file, the two would be the same number. The IndexedDB store therefore behaves like
the random-access file the packed format was designed against, and the ~1 MiB chunking fallback is
not needed.

**OPFS turned out to be available everywhere** — the earlier "missing on every device" reading was
an insecure origin, as suspected, and the probe now reports `isSecureContext` first so it cannot be
misread again. It is still not used. `createSyncAccessHandle` is `[Exposed=DedicatedWorker]` and is
correctly absent from the main thread on all three, so the fast OPFS path would mean moving reads
into a worker — for a store that is already measured fast enough, in a database the application
already uses. Revisit only if a lookup ever becomes slow enough to notice, which at 0.00–1.40 ms it
is not.

**Storage headroom is a non-issue at these sizes**, reinforcing §8: the tightest quota measured is
10 GiB against a 27.8 MiB artifact. `persisted()` is false everywhere until asked, which is why
`persist()` is requested once after an install succeeds.

---

## §12 · Stage 3 — the reading surfaces, as built

Three modules and one rule. `web/src/dictionaries.ts` gained the search transports beside the lookup
it already had; `externalEntries.ts` merges and ranks what they answer and is pure, the way
`selectors.ts` is; `externalHtml.ts` turns an `html`-tier payload into Acervo's own marks;
`ExternalArticle.tsx` renders both tiers through `LexemeArticle.tsx`'s classes. The rule is that
**your own words answer first, always, and external results sit below a rule and say whose they
are.** This is a personal vocabulary store that can consult a dictionary, not a dictionary browser
that remembers some words.

### Three speeds, because the tiers cost different amounts

| Tier | When it runs | Why |
|---|---|---|
| your words | every keystroke | in memory |
| dictionaries on this device | 120 ms debounce | 0.00–1.40 ms per read (§11.7) |
| dictionaries on your server | 450 ms debounce | a prefix search is ~17 sequential range reads; the reader's restart-key cache makes repeats far cheaper |
| online sources | **⏎ only** | §9's no-prefetch rule, and a rate limit should not be spent on a word someone was passing through |

Under that sits a per-source result cache and a one-second floor between calls to the same online
source, in the module that owns the transport rather than in the interface that happens to call it.

### Results merge by word, not by dictionary

Three dictionaries holding `casa` is one row naming three sources, not three rows of `casa`.
Grouping by dictionary was the alternative and it floods the section: the reader is looking for a
word, and which books carry it is a fact *about* the word. Opening one gives a single page with a
section per source in resolution order, and sticky jump chips to move between them — comparing what
two dictionaries say is most of the reason for having two, so a tab hiding one behind the other
would work against the feature.

### What rendering the `html` tier actually took

§11.4 said these payloads "need restyling, not merely sanitising", and building it confirmed that
with more force than expected. There are **three distinct source shapes**, all three measured off
the compiled artifacts rather than assumed:

1. **WikDict / PyGlossary** — clean, and semantically almost empty. A bare `<div>` is the part of
   speech at one depth and a translation at another; position is the only signal. The reader
   resolves it positionally, with a list of part-of-speech words for the case where position is
   ambiguous.
2. **Yomitan-derived (`wty-*`)** — the good case, and the surprise. Every node carries a `content=`
   attribute naming what it *is*: `glosses`, `tags`, `example-sentence-a`/`-b`, `bold-text`,
   `details-entry-Etymology`, `backlink`. Most of the mapper is reading those names.
3. **ECDICT** — one list item of preformatted plain text with newlines, which renders as a wall
   unless split.

Three bugs came out of rendering real entries rather than fixtures, and none would have been found
by reading the markup:

- **Renaming the Yomitan `<summary>` destroyed the fold.** Mapping `content="summary-entry"` onto a
  styled `<span>` left the `<details>` with no summary, so the browser drew its own "Details" where
  the source said "Grammar", "Etymology" or "3 examples".
- **Half the definitions grew a translation arrow.** A text-only `<div>` that is the *whole* of its
  list item is that item's content — Yomitan wraps every gloss that way — not a translation of it.
- **A list of one is a wrapper, not a list.** Every source nests the entry inside `<ol><li>` before
  the senses begin, which put a meaningless "01." in front of the word.

`tests/../web/src/externalHtml.test.ts` runs over real payloads from five dictionaries
(`web/src/testFixtures/dictionaryHtml.json`), because every one of the above passed a synthetic
fixture.

### "Add to my words" is a capture, not a second writer

Three treatments — keep it close to the source, fill in the gaps, or say what you want — and all
three go through the existing capture route. The request gained `reference` and `referenceMode`;
the two canned treatments are wordings in `prompts/acervo_compose.md`, because prompts are content
and a treatment is a thing to say, not a branch to write.

> ### DECISION
> **A dictionary entry is sent as `reference`, never as `text`.**
>
> **Because** the resolver reads `text` as sentences the learner supplied, and every one of them
> becomes an attestation. A dictionary's own examples arriving as attestations would be a claim
> about where this person met the word, forged out of a book they were only reading. Provenance is
> modelled here, never flagged (`§ Data rules`), and this separation *is* the modelling: two
> fields, two doors, and the compose prompt says out loud that an example drawn from the reference
> carries `fromSentence: null` like any other invented one.

### What is deliberately not here

No caching of dictionary entries in the replica, no dictionary row in PocketBase, and no path by
which an external entry becomes a record without passing through `parseArticle` and
`repository.saveArticle`. An external entry stays render-only: it carries `posLabel` as free text
and never meets Acervo's part-of-speech enum (§11.3).

### §12.1 · What a survey of all 45 compiled dictionaries changed

The first pass was checked against six entries from five dictionaries. That was not enough: sampling
six random headwords from **every** compiled artifact — 270 entries, 45 dictionaries — and rendering
them through the real components found faults on the sixth of them that six entries could not.
The apparatus is a throwaway script, and the value was in *reading the output*, not in the script.

**Faults the survey found, all now fixed and all counted before and after:**

| | before | after |
|---|---:|---:|
| Senses printed twice, one copy carrying the examples | 6 | 0 |
| `«««` form-of stubs, one titled block each | 9 | 0 |
| A domain written into the definition as `Química\| …` | 6 | 2 |
| Numbered items with nothing in them | yes | 0 |
| Wiki-link syntax `[[учебный]]` reaching the page | yes | 0 |

The two remaining pipes are real CC-CEDICT cross-references — `涼山彝族自治州|凉山彝族自治州[…]` — which
is that dictionary's own notation and not an artefact.

**The rendering decisions those findings produced**, each of them a removal rather than an addition:

- **A sense that appears twice is one sense.** Deduplicated on a key that strips combining acute, so
  the Russian habit of listing a word once with stress marks and once without collapses too; the
  examples from both copies merge into the survivor.
- **A label the source wrote belongs in the field that exists for it.** `Química| Compuesto…` becomes
  a domain chip, which is what the mapped tier already does with `domain`.
- **A list of one is not a list**, and neither is a list item that holds only another list. Both were
  putting an empty `01.` in front of the thing they held. A single sense now reads as a statement.
- **A nested level counts differently** — `a. b. c.` under `01 02 03` — because two identical columns
  of numbers at different indents read as one broken list.
- **A section says only what the masthead has not.** `n · ja` under a masthead reading
  `n · Japanese · external dictionary` was on almost every entry of every single-source dictionary.
- **Numbered pinyin is a storage format, not a word.** `Fang1 shan1 Xian4` renders as `Fāng shān Xiàn`
  (`web/src/pinyin.ts`), in the reading and in the cross-references CC-CEDICT writes inside a
  definition. Syllables are not joined: CC-CEDICT does not record where words begin, and joining
  would be a guess.

### §12.2 · Three bugs that were not about dictionaries at all

- **Online sources could never answer.** A dictionary was searched only if its id was in a set of
  *switched-on* ids, and the only thing that ever added an id was installing one — which an online
  source cannot be. So the interface offered "press ⏎ to look this up online" and then had nothing
  to ask. The store now holds what is switched **off**: anything Acervo can reach is on until someone
  says otherwise. The search section also now says *why* a tier was empty — switched off, unreachable,
  or genuinely not holding the word are three different answers and only one is about the word.
- **Russian was set in a CJK face.** `--sans` listed `PingFang SC` ahead of `system-ui`, and the
  Cyrillic subset of IBM Plex Sans was imported at weights 400 and 500 but not 600 — which is the
  weight a gloss term is set in. A stack is consulted per character, so every bold Russian gloss fell
  out of the family and onto the first face that had the glyphs, set on CJK metrics. Both halves are
  fixed: the subsets now cover every weight and style the interface uses, and the CJK faces sit after
  `system-ui` so they can never capture Cyrillic or Greek again.
- **The reference fold missed every gendered noun.** It looked up `headword`, and Acervo stores
  `la azafata` there because that is how a learner needs to see the word — while a dictionary is keyed
  on `azafata`. `lemma` is already defined as "the dictionary form", so a lookup now takes both.
  Deliberately not a rule about articles: nothing knows that `la` is one, and the same field answers
  for a verb stored conjugated or a noun stored with a classifier.

### §12.3 · What the survey did not fix, and will not

Several sources are simply thin — a Wiktionary inflection entry says "inflection of lastimar" because
that is all it knows, and no amount of rendering makes it say more. The rule applied throughout was
to remove what the source never meant to publish and to promote what it did, and to stop there. A
poor dictionary should look plain; it should not look broken, and it should not be dressed up.
Choosing which dictionaries are worth carrying is a separate job from rendering them well.

### §12.4 · Two faults that only a long result list showed

Both were invisible on a short search and obvious on `casa`, which seven Spanish dictionaries answer.

- **The list showed more rows than it could describe.** Merging across seven dictionaries produced
  thirty-four rows; only the first fourteen were given a meaning, and the rest rendered as a column
  of em-dashes — which reads as a search that found nothing, not as one that found plenty. Reading a
  row's meaning costs a lookup in the dictionary holding it, and several byte-range requests when
  that dictionary is on the server, so the cap and the hydration limit have to be the same number.
  The list now shows the closest twelve, describes all twelve, and says how many matched.
- **A gloss was taken from whichever source sorted first.** Alphabetical order put an `html` source
  ahead of a mapped one, and reading a meaning back out of a rendered fragment gave
  `nounbrothelwhorehouselupanar` where the mapped source had `brothel; whorehouse`. Candidates are
  now tried mapped-first, the first non-empty answer wins, and an `html` gloss is assembled block by
  block with the parts that describe the word rather than define it — its part of speech, its tags,
  its backlinks — left out.

The jump chips also stopped landing on their headings again once a word was held by six sources: the
nav is sticky and wraps to two or three rows, so no fixed `scroll-margin-top` can be right for every
entry. It is measured from the nav and re-measured when it resizes.

### §12.5 · Prefix search was case-sensitive, and only prefix search

`lookup` folded case from the beginning — the compiler stores a case-folded alias beside every key
that needs one, and the reader falls back to it. `search` did not, because a prefix scan walks the
sorted key bytes: `Mejor` looked for keys beginning `Mejor` and there are none, while `mejor` found
the word. The two halves of the same reader disagreed, and a phone capitalises the first letter of
everything typed into a search box, so the common case was the broken one.

Both spellings are now scanned, and each gets the **full** result budget rather than a share of one.
That second part matters as much as the first: letting the as-typed scan fill the list is how `Casa`
came back as `Casa Blanca · Casablanca · Casadevante` and never `casa`. When the pool has to be
trimmed, the word actually typed leads it. Results are deduplicated by *entry*, not by spelling, so
a key and its folded alias are one row rather than the same word listed twice.

The online tier folds the same way, and in the same order — as typed first, because a proper noun
may only be held capitalised — which costs one extra request only on a miss, behind the ⏎ that was
already required.
