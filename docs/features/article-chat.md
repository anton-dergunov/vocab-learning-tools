# Article chat and LLM editing

**Status:** built, and this is its design. Everything below describes what ships, except where a
**SUPERSEDED** note says otherwise — four of those, all because the codebase moved after this was
written and before it was built. This is the working design for design `§06`, which fixed the
stance — *"chat lives inside the article, and its output is a proposed revision of that record"* —
and then declared itself out of scope. Everything `§06` decided still holds. What follows is the
part it did not settle: how the model returns an edit, how the edit is shown, where the
conversation sits on a phone, and which four places in the interface open one.

It also closes a loose end `§05` left open. The capture route's duplicate branch used to say, in a
comment, that merging a repeat capture into the entry it belongs to *"needs the article conversation
to do it well."* This design is that job, and `§8.3` is now built.

Two deliberate revisions to `§06` are marked **§06 REVISED** where they occur.

---

## §1 · What is actually missing

Acervo can build an entry and it can read one. It cannot be argued with. Everything that happens
*after* the entry is on screen and not quite right currently has one route: open the YAML, and be
an editor.

Four situations, all of them ordinary, none of them served:

1. **Explain.** *What is the difference between `el traje` and `el disfraz`? Why is that subjunctive?
   Is this note actually true?* The answer is prose. Nothing changes.
2. **Improve.** *Add a note about how it differs from `el traje`. Give me one more example, in a
   restaurant. This translation is stiff — fix it.* The answer is an edit to one small part of one
   record.
3. **Contribute.** *I heard this on the radio: «…».* That sentence is an **attestation**, and the
   example drawn from it carries `origin: "attestation"`. This is not a variant of (2): the data
   model treats it differently, and so must the chat.
4. **Look up something you do not hold.** A word found through external dictionaries, whose entries
   are — honestly — uneven. The useful question there is *what does this actually mean, and should I
   keep it?* The only action available is the one that already exists: capture it.

The workaround for all four needs no software — copy the article into a chat, ask, paste back —
and `§06` already says why that is the wrong shape: the model does not know the schema, so the
answer is prose you re-key by hand; it does not know the rest of the store, so it cannot say *"you
already have `mareo`, and here is the contrast"*; and the round trip is long enough that you stop.

> ### The one-line summary
> **A turn of conversation returns prose, and — only when the turn implies a change — a set of small
> edit operations against the record. The operations are applied to a draft on the device, the draft
> is rendered as an ordinary article with change marks, and approving it is the same
> `saveArticle(parseArticle(text))` call every other write already makes.**

## §2 · Prior art, and what is worth taking

| Product | The pattern | What is worth taking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Notion — suggested edits](https://www.notion.com/help/suggested-edits) | Edits land in the document itself, underlined and coloured; removals struck through rather than deleted; ✔/✕ per suggestion. | **The document is the diff.** No separate compare view. This is exactly right for an article. |
| [Notion AI — edit with AI](https://www.notion.com/help/guides/notion-ai-for-docs) | Select text → prompt → accept / discard / try again. | Selection as the unit of conditioning. A model told *which part* stays inside it. |
| ChatGPT Canvas / Claude Artifacts | Document on one side, conversation on the other; the model rewrites in place. | The split works on a laptop and collapses badly on a phone — see `§7`. |
| Cursor and the IDE agents | The model returns *targeted edits*, not a rewritten file, and the editor applies and marks them. | The whole of `§4`. This is a solved problem and the solution is structured operations. |
| Google Docs / Gemini "help me refine" | Suggestions arrive as comment-shaped cards anchored to a paragraph. | Anchoring. A suggestion that points at a paragraph is easier to judge than one that floats. |
| Apple Writing Tools | Sheet over the content, content stays visible, results replace in place. | The sheet, and the discipline of a very short result. |
| [Migaku](https://migaku.com/) | AI explanation of a word in context, word-by-word sentence breakdown, from inside the card. | The closest thing in this space, and it stops at explanation: nothing it says can change the card. That gap is the whole opportunity. |
| Readwise Reader — Ghostreader | Prompt presets ("explain like I'm 5", "define in context") beside the text; the result can be saved as a note. | **Presets beat a blank box on a phone**, where typing is the cost. Becomes `followUps` in `§5`. |

Two negative findings matter as much:

- **Nobody in language learning does (2) or (3).** Migaku, LingQ and the Anki AI add-ons all
  generate a card and then leave it alone. An editable, model-assisted personal entry is not a
  feature Acervo would be copying.
- **The chat-beside-the-document layout is a desktop artefact.** Every product that has it also has
  a phone build where it degrades to a full-screen chat that hides the document — which is precisely
  the thing being discussed. `§7` refuses that.

---

## §3 · Three decisions

### §3.1 · How the model returns an edit

| | Whole draft returned | Text patch on the YAML | **Structured operations** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Wire size | O(article) every turn | small | small |
| Reuses `composeArticle` | yes | no | partly |
| Localised by construction | **no** | yes | **yes** |
| Failure mode | silently drops a field, rephrases an untouched sense | applies in the wrong place with no error signal | names an id that does not exist — **caught** |
| Small model tolerance | poor | poor | good |

The literature is unambiguous and matches what IDE agents converged on: a whole-file rewrite is
capability-dependent and non-deterministically drops or perturbs untouched content, and a
model-authored unified diff is worse — under a tolerant patcher a meaningful fraction of diffs
apply *in the wrong place, silently*. Path-addressed structured operations are validated at the
field level before anything is applied.

The configured default model here is `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`. That settles it on its own.

> ### DECISION
> **A turn returns prose plus, optionally, a list of at most twelve edit operations addressed by
> record id.**
>
> **Because** the operations are checkable before they are applied — every id either exists in the
> document that was sent or the whole proposal is refused — and because "add one example to sense 2"
> is a thing the model can get right, where "reproduce this article with one example added" is a
> thing it can get *almost* right.
>
> **And crucially:** the operations are the *wire format only*. They are applied to produce a new
> draft, and the change marks in `§6` are computed by comparing the two drafts by record id — never
> by reading the operations. If the operation language ever proves to be a bad fit for a future
> model, whole-draft return can replace it without touching the interface at all.

### §3.2 · Tool calling, or one constrained answer

Tool calling would buy a multi-turn loop in which the model asks for things: *look up `traje` in the
learner's store*, *search the external dictionary*, *fetch the sibling sense*.

Against it, specifically here:

- **SUPERSEDED — the runtime argument is void; the conclusion is not.** The PocketBase JS hooks are
  gone, replaced by one Python service, and `api/routes/capture.py` already runs *two* sequential
  120-second model calls inside `run_in_threadpool`. A loop would cost nothing structurally. Three
  reasons hold in its place: `acervo/models/` stands alone and has no tool-call shape, so `text()`,
  `chain.walk`, `chain.stamped` and `cooldown` would all need a second path; requiring tool support
  would make every `prompt`-tier row in `models/catalogue.json` unusable for chat, against a chain
  design whose whole point is that the owner picks; and the retrieval a tool would perform is the
  next point, which was always the real argument.
- **The retrieval a tool would perform is already local.** The replica is complete and on the
  device. The client can select the twenty neighbouring entries worth sending before the request is
  made, for free and offline. A tool call would fetch, slowly and over the network, something the
  caller already had in hand.
- **The dictionaries are already on screen.** If external entries are open, their text is what the
  reader is looking at. Sending it is one field, not a tool.

> ### DECISION
> **One model call per turn. One JSON object back. No tool loop.**
>
> **Because** every tool the loop would call is answerable from the replica before the request
> leaves, and the runtime that would host the loop is the wrong place for one. Requiring tool-call
> support would also narrow which models this can run against, which is a cost with no matching
> benefit today.
>
> **Revisit when** a question genuinely needs the *corpus* (`§07`) rather than the replica — that
> lives on the server, is too large to preload, and is the first real argument for a second hop.

### §3.3 · Where the conversation lives

> ### DECISION
> **In memory on the device, keyed by what is being discussed, resent whole on every turn, and lost
> on reload.**
>
> **Because** `§01`'s test for whether something belongs in the core is whether losing it would
> hurt, and losing a transcript costs nothing — the *article* is where the value landed. This also
> keeps the route stateless: no chat collection, no session store, nothing to synchronise, nothing
> to tombstone. `§06` already committed to this and it survives contact with the design.
>
> The last **eight** turns are resent, and the article document is resent every turn — so after a
> proposal is applied, the model sees the applied article, not the one it was asked about.

---

## §4 · What is sent, and what it is told about it

The request is assembled on the device, because the device is where the record, the replica and the
dictionary text already are.

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**§06 REVISED.** `§06` says *"the PWA sends the lexeme id and the question; the server attaches the
record."* It cannot, and should not. `AGENTS.md` fixes `yaml.ts` as the only place the projection is
understood; a server-side serialiser would be a second implementation of it, drifting from the first
the moment a field is added. So the device sends the document it already has. Nothing is lost by
this: the server still holds the credentials, still owns the prompt, still shapes the answer, and
still writes nothing — the document it receives came from that owner's own replica and goes nowhere
but into their own prompt.

### The hierarchy, stated to the model in as many words

This is the part that must not be left to inference. The external dictionaries are frequently worse
than the entry the reader is looking at — machine-extracted, unevenly edited, sometimes wrong about
register, often missing the sense that matters — and a model handed two documents with no ranking
will average them. The prompt says, close to verbatim:

> **The article** is the learner's own entry for this word, in the projection Acervo stores. It is
> the source of truth. They wrote or approved every line of it, it is glossed into their own
> languages, and some of its examples are sentences they personally met. It is the only thing you
> may propose changing.
>
> **The dictionaries**, when present, are external reference: third-party sources the learner happens
> to have open on the same screen, below their own entry. They are read-only — the learner cannot
> edit them and neither can you — and they are often poor. Use one to check a fact, to find a sense
> the article is missing, or because the learner is asking about something they read there. Never
> treat one as outranking the article, and never propose a change to one.

---

## §5 · The answer, and the edit language

One JSON object. No prose outside it, same as every other prompt in `prompts/`.

```jsonc
{
  "reply": "«el traje» is any outfit or suit — a business suit, a regional costume …",
  "followUps": ["Add that to the notes", "One more example", "How do I remember it?"],
  "proposal": {
    "summary": "Adds the contrast with «el traje» to the notes, and one example under sense 1.",
    "ops": [ /* … */ ]
  }
}
```

- **`reply`** is the answer, and most turns are only this. Short — it is read on a phone above a
  keyboard. Capped at ~1200 characters server-side.
- **`followUps`** are up to three one-tap next turns, ≤40 characters each. This is the single
  highest-value field on mobile: it is the difference between a feature you use standing on a train
  and one you use at a desk. Free — same call.
- **`proposal`** is present **only when the turn implies a change.** A question gets an answer and
  nothing else. The prompt says so explicitly, and `§5.3` says it again.

### §5.1 · Operations

A target is a flat token — `lexeme`, or `<kind>:<id>` — because a flat string is what models get
right. Every id must already occur in the document that was sent.

**REVISED in round two** — the operation names were repetitive, and `add` encoded in three names
what a `target` already says. Every operation is now an `op` and a `target`, and the parent is a
named field rather than part of the operation's name:

```ts
type Target = "lexeme" | `sense:${string}` | `example:${string}` | `attestation:${string}`;

type EditOp =
  | { op: "set";     target: Target; field: string; value: unknown }
  | { op: "add";     target: "sense";       after?: string | null; value: SenseValue }
  | { op: "add";     target: "example";     in: string; fromAttestation?: string | null;
                     value: ExampleValue }
  | { op: "add";     target: "attestation"; ref: string; value: AttestationValue }
  | { op: "remove";  target: Target; reason?: string }
  | { op: "reorder"; target: "senses"; ids: string[] };
```

`target` names a record everywhere except on `add` and `reorder`, where the record does not exist
yet and it names a kind. This is legibility rather than accuracy — the old names worked — and it is
cheap precisely because `§3.1`'s escape hatch is real: the marks are computed from drafts, so the
operation language is a detail of one request.

Settable fields, and nothing else:

| Target | Fields |
| --- | --- |
| `lexeme` | `headword` `lemma` `reading` `ipa` `pos` `gender` `register` `dialect` `emoji` `shortGloss` `notes` `topics` `status` |
| `sense:…` | `definition` `definitionLang` `domain` `glosses` |
| `example:…` | `text` `translation` `note` `matchedForm` `matchedTranslationForm` |
| `attestation:…` | `text` `translation` `sourceTitle` `sourceUrl` `sourceKind` |

`language` and `id` are not settable. `revision`, `editedAt`, `editedBy`, `deleted` and `ownerId` do
not appear in the projection at all and therefore cannot be addressed. Study state is written into
the YAML as comments (`yaml.ts`) precisely so it cannot be saved back by accident, and it is
likewise invisible here. Image prompts are their own stage (`§09`) and are out of scope for chat.

### §5.2 · Two rules the data model imposes

**Ids are minted by the device, never by the model.** `AGENTS.md`: *a document editing a stored entry
may not carry ids its producer minted, and an unknown id there is refused.* So `addSense`,
`addExample` and `addAttestation` carry **no id**. The applier leaves the id null and `saveArticle`
mints it, exactly as it does for a hand-written block with no id. Where a new example must name a
new attestation, `addAttestation` carries a **`ref`** — an arbitrary short label — and the matching
`addExample` carries `fromAttestation: "<ref>"`. The applier resolves the ref locally and mints both
ids together.

**Provenance is modelled, not flagged.** An example the model wrote gets `origin: "llm"` and the
`modelId` of the model that wrote it. A sentence the *owner* supplied in the conversation is an
attestation, and the example drawn from it gets `origin: "attestation"` and names it. The model does
not set `origin` at all — the applier derives it from which operation created the example. There is
no field meaning "a person wrote this", and chat does not get one.

```jsonc
// "I heard this on the radio: «Se disfrazó de médico para entrar.»"
[
  { "op": "addAttestation", "ref": "a1",
    "attestation": { "text": "Se disfrazó de médico para entrar.",
                     "translation": "He dressed up as a doctor to get in.",
                     "sourceKind": "video", "sourceTitle": "Radio" } },
  { "op": "addExample", "senseId": "kq2m7x1p4vd9r0s", "fromAttestation": "a1",
    "example": { "text": "Se disfrazó de médico para entrar.",
                 "translation": "He dressed up as a doctor to get in.",
                 "matchedForm": "disfrazó", "matchedTranslationForm": "dressed up" } }
]
```

### §5.3 · Small, or nothing

Verbatim from the prompt, because this is where the feature either stays trustworthy or stops
being one:

> An edit changes the smallest thing that is wrong or missing: one field, one example, one note.
> You are not rewriting the article and you must not produce one.
>
> - Never touch a record the turn did not ask about.
> - Never restate an existing sense in your own words because you would have phrased it
>   differently. The learner's article is not a draft of yours.
> - If the honest answer is "nothing needs to change" — including "no, that is not an error, it is
>   how the word works" — say so and return no proposal. That is a good answer and the most common
>   correct one.
> - If what they want genuinely requires the article to be rebuilt, say so in `reply` and propose
>   nothing. That is a different action and they will choose it themselves.

Enforced, not merely asked for: **at most twelve operations**, and a proposal touching more than
half of the article's records is refused by the device with *"that was a rewrite rather than an
edit, so nothing was changed"*. A cap the model cannot argue with is worth more than a paragraph it
can.

### §5.4 · The reference subject

When the subject is an external entry rather than one of the owner's own words, the shape changes
and the prompt is a different tracked file. There is no `proposal`, because there is nothing
editable on screen. There is instead:

```jsonc
{ "reply": "…", "followUps": ["…"],
  "capture": { "headword": "el disfraz", "referenceMode": "expand",
               "note": "contrast it with «el traje»; they asked about theatre use" } }
```

`capture` is not a write and not a second pipeline. It is the argument list for the capture the
interface already performs from an external article: it becomes a `CaptureSeed`, `AddView` opens
and processes it, and everything downstream — resolve, compose, review, `saveArticle` — is
unchanged. Note what is *not* sent onward: the transcript. The model writes the `note` because it
knows what in the conversation mattered; shipping the raw thread would mean changing
`CaptureRequest` and teaching `acervo_compose` to read a conversation. One sentence does the job.

---

## §6 · Applying, showing, saving, undoing

Nothing new is invented on the write path. The whole pipeline is existing parts in a new order:

                                   saveArticle(parseArticle(text'))          discard
                                       — the one writer —
```

Two new pure functions, in one new module `web/src/articleEdit.ts`, beside `selectors.ts` and
`yaml.ts` and pure like them:

- `applyOps(draft, ops): ArticleDraft` — all-or-nothing. An id that is not in the draft, a field
  that is not settable, a value of the wrong type, a `ref` that resolves to nothing: the whole
  proposal is refused with one plain sentence. No partial application, ever.
- `diffDrafts(before, after): DraftDiff` — record id → `added | changed | removed`, plus the set of
  changed fields on the lexeme head, plus removed records carried over whole from `before` so they
  can still be drawn.

**The marks come from `diffDrafts`, not from the operations.** That is what makes `§3.1`'s escape
hatch real, and it also means a hand-edit in the YAML tab could be marked by the same machinery if
that ever proves useful.

### §6.1 · Rendering a proposal is already a solved case

`AGENTS.md` warns: *do not render articles by round-tripping stored records through YAML text; the
projection is for editing and serializing, not for display.* Reading a stored article stays
`articleFor(graph, id)` and always will. But a proposal is **not a stored article** — it is an
unsaved document under review, which is exactly the case `articleFromDraft` exists for and exactly
what `AddView` already does with a generated entry. A live proposal puts the article view into
`AddView`'s regime for as long as it lasts, and leaves it the moment the proposal is saved or
discarded. Same component, same rule, no third feeder.

### §6.2 · A diff for someone who is not an engineer

No side-by-side, no unified diff, no `+++`/`---`. The article renders normally and the changed parts
say so in the margin — Notion's approach, in Acervo's marks and Acervo's palette.

  **no mark may change where body text sits**, a rule the first version broke in three places.
  `moved` is a fourth mark, because a reorder previously produced no marks and a count of zero over
  an article that had silently renumbered itself.
- **A changed field carries a word-level diff**, computed on the device: the words that went struck
  through in `--warn`, the words that arrived in `--core`. Without it `changed` said only that
  something moved, and a reworded note — matched by text — read as a deletion beside an addition
  rather than as one change. No model is asked what it did: a model's account of its own edit is one
  more thing that can be wrong. **Word level, not character level, and hand-written** (`wordDiff.ts`)
  rather than a dependency, because the same `lcs` also finds the minimal set a reorder moved — the
  complement of the longest increasing subsequence, so rotating three senses is one change — and
  measures how alike two notes are. The tokeniser is `Intl.Segmenter`, because `\p{L}+` makes a Han
  sentence one token and the diff would report "everything replaced" for exactly the languages a
  learner needs it in most.
- **Where a block has no spare gutter** — a note, whose 15px holds an em-dash — it borrows 14px from
  the pane with an equal negative margin and pins the dash back, so the content edge does not move.
  *Rejected:* replacing a marked note's em-dash with the mark; the note stops looking like a member
  of its own list, and 3px of bar plus 7px of glyph does not fit in 15px anyway. The rule lives in
  the stylesheet above the `.mark` block, because jsdom does no layout and no test can catch it.
- **Only the field that changed is tinted** on a large block. A changed definition tints the
  definition and the sense keeps its rail bar; tinting the whole section would claim its untouched
  examples had changed. Small blocks — an example, an attestation, a note — tint whole.
- Colour: added and changed take `--core-soft`, removed takes `--warn-soft` with strikethrough.
  Existing tokens, correct in both themes, no red/green added to a palette that has neither.
- The mark is the *only* addition. The example still renders through `ExampleBlock`, still shows
  `llm · <model> · unapproved`, and still looks like the article it is about to become.
- The review bar is sticky at the top of the pane for as long as a proposal is live, the pane
  scrolls to the first mark when one arrives, and `‹ 1/3 ›` steps through the rest in the order the
  article draws them. It never wraps: on a phone the sentence shortens rather than taking a second
  row of a screen that has none to spare.

Deliberately left unmarked: **`matchedForm`**, because `realign()` may drop it as a side effect of
setting `text`, so marking it would report a change nobody asked for; and a marked example's
**`.ex.own` teal**, which gives way to the mark for the length of the review — the `origin` chip still
says `attestation`, and one signal per gutter is the limit. There are no keyboard shortcuts for next
and previous: they would fight the composer, which is where the hands already are.

**The YAML tab shows the proposed document and does not mark it.** The reason is that the YAML tab
is the escape hatch, not the review surface: someone who opens it wants to edit the text, and
gutter decorations there are answering a question the Article tab already answered. (CodeMirror
would make a tinted gutter nearly free, so this is a cheap thing to add later if it turns out to be
missed — but not first.)

### §6.3 · Saving, staleness, and undo

- **Saving** is `saveArticle(parseArticle(text'))`. Identical to saving a hand-edited document:
  same validation, same id diffing, same online-only synchronous round trip, same revision check.
  A chat-driven edit is indistinguishable downstream from a typed one, which is what `§06` asked
  for and what keeps `§01`'s regeneration promise honest.
- **A stale entry is refused, not merged.** If sync moved the record while the conversation was
  open, the write is refused by the server exactly as any other stale write is. The message says the
  entry changed elsewhere and the proposal is dropped.
- **A proposal is dropped** when the entry is hand-edited, when sync brings a new revision of it, or
  when the reader leaves the article. It is a suggestion, not a state.
- **Undo is the previous document, saved again.** The pre-edit text is held for the length of the
  session; undoing is one more `saveArticle`. This works without any special support because
  removed children are tombstoned rather than erased and `repository.stamp` sets `deleted: false` —
  naming a tombstoned id in a document brings the record back, id intact. Undo is offered as a
  single action on the toast after saving, and it is an ordinary online write like everything else.

## §7 · The interface

The hard constraint is not the laptop. It is a phone in portrait with the keyboard up, where the
usable height is roughly 300–380 px, and both the article and the conversation have to be legible in
it. Every product surveyed in `§2` solves the wide case and degrades the narrow one into a
full-screen chat that hides the document. That is the one outcome to avoid, because on the device
where the document is hardest to see is exactly where hiding it hurts most.

### §7.1 · One surface at every width

> ### DECISION
> **An ask dock pinned to the bottom of the article pane, which grows upward into a sheet. One
> component, one set of states, at every width. No side pane, ever.**
>
> **Because** the article column is 780 px (`.pane`; `--measure` is declared in the stylesheet and
> unused, so CSS written against it would do nothing) and a tablet in portrait — the primary reading
> device here — is about 834 px wide. A docked side pane would cut the article to
> roughly 400 px to make room for a conversation that is usually two turns long. The dock costs the
> article nothing horizontally at any width, and on a phone it *is* the mobile design rather than a
> degraded version of a desktop one.
>
> **And:** the answer to an editing turn is not a chat message. It is the article. The sheet
> collapses when a proposal arrives.

### §7.2 · Wide — tablet landscape, macOS

                the dock — pinned to the pane, at the article measure
```

`[✳]` is the anchor affordance, shown on hover or focus beside a sense and an example. Tapping one
sets a **focus chip** in the dock — `about sense 1 ✕` — which both prefixes the turn and tells the
model to keep its edits inside that record. This is Notion's selection-conditioning and Google
Docs' anchoring, and it is worth more on a phone than on a laptop: it removes the need to type
*"the second example"*.

Open, mid-conversation — the sheet shares the pane's bottom edge and the article scrolls behind it:

```

The proposal arrives as a **card in the thread, not as an applied change.** Pressing *Review*
applies it to the draft, collapses the sheet to the dock, and scrolls the article to the first mark
— `§6.2`. Nothing is written until *Save changes*.

### §7.3 · Narrow — a phone with the keyboard up

Three detents: **dock** (the bar alone) → **open** → **full** (the thread alone, with the masthead
pinned above it as a context strip so the word being discussed is never off screen).

**REVISED in round two.** `open` was "about 45% of the pane", which reserved a large empty box the
moment you focused the composer; it is now content-sized with a cap, so a fresh conversation is one
line and it grows turn by turn. `full` was `100dvh - 96px`, whose magic number left a useless
one-line strip of article above the sheet — it now takes the pane and the article is not drawn at
all, at every width, because that strip was a desktop defect too. The focus chip sits on its own row
above the composer rather than inside it, at every width: inline, it left an Android field about
180px wide.

`full` uses `.main.composing`, which already existed for the YAML editor and the Add view — *a surface
that owns the height and scrolls itself must not sit inside a region that also scrolls.* `overflow:
hidden` clamps `scrollTop` to zero, so the article's offset is parked on the way in and restored on
the way out. *Rejected:* `position: fixed` with insets, because `.viewport` sets `container-type:
inline-size` and so becomes the containing block for fixed descendants, and the insets would have to
clear a top bar on one layout and a top bar plus a rail of changing height on the other. The Add view
has no `full` detent: that surface is itself a review, and its composer already owns the height.

```

What makes this work on a phone, in order of importance:

1. **The answer is the article.** The sheet is a launcher and a reading surface for prose; the
   moment there is a change to look at, it gets out of the way. Most of what the reader looks at is
   the entry, not a transcript.
2. **`followUps` and the focus chip.** Two taps replace two sentences of typing. This is the
   difference between a feature used on a train and one used at a desk.
3. **Only the last turn or two above the keyboard.** The thread is bottom-anchored; the composer is
   docked; the scroller carries bottom padding equal to the composer plus the safe-area inset.
4. **The masthead stays.** At the `full` detent the article is hidden but the word is not.

**The keyboard needs real work, and the app does none of it today.** `web/index.html` has no
`interactive-widget` directive and nothing reads `visualViewport`. Both are required: add
`interactive-widget=resizes-content` to the viewport meta, and drive the sheet's bottom offset from
`visualViewport` for iOS Safari, which does not honour the directive. Without this the composer
lands under the keyboard on exactly the device this feature is for.

   └───────────────────────┴── failed (offline · refused · unusable) ───┘
```

- **thinking** — a quiet line in the thread, not a spinner over the article. The article stays
  readable and scrollable throughout; nothing about a pending turn locks it.
- **failed** — offline is an ordinary state, phrased as one: *"Chat needs the server. Your words are
  all still here."* Reading never depends on it.
- **marked** — the only state that changes what the article looks like, and it is always reversible
  with one press.
- The dock is disabled with that same sentence when the server is unreachable, and hidden entirely
  when the server reports no model configured — the capture surface already knows how to say this.

### §7.5 · The prototype

`AGENTS.md` binds `web/src/styles.css` to `design/ui-prototype/`: they change together, never one
alone. The dock, the three detents, the proposal card, the diff marks and the review bar all land in
`acervo.css` and in the prototype in the same change. **SUPERSEDED in one detail:** there is no
"static article page" — the prototype is a shell plus `app.js`, whose `renderArticle` paints the
article, so `renderAsk` lands there beside it. The one legitimate
divergence stays where it is — the prototype has no bundler, so its editor pane remains a picture.

One new mark is needed in `icons.tsx` for the dock and the anchor affordance. `✳` is already the
article's own mark for *where you met it*, so the ask affordance should not reuse it — a distinct
glyph, chosen with the prototype.

---

## §8 · Four entry points

### §8.1 · Your own article — the primary case

Everything above. The dock is present on every stored article, in `Read` mode, at every width.

### §8.2 · An external article

Same dock, same sheet, different prompt and no proposals. The subject is the dictionary text; the
owner's replica is not sent, because they do not hold this word. The only action the model can
offer is `capture` (`§5.4`), which surfaces as a card:

```
 │  ✳  Two of the three dictionaries have this as a nautical term;  │
 │     the third has only the figurative sense. If you keep it,     │
 │     the nautical sense is the one worth having first.            │
 │                                                                  │
 │     ┌ ✚  Add to my words ──────────────────────────────────┐     │
 │     │    with what you asked for            Add  ▸         │     │
 │     └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘     │
```

Pressing it opens `AddView` with a `CaptureSeed` whose `note` the model wrote. That is the existing
"Add to my words" path with one field filled in — no new writer, no new route, no second pipeline.
The entry still goes as `reference`, never as `text`, so a dictionary's examples still cannot become
attestations.

### §8.3 · A capture that is already held — the fold-in

Today `captureRoute` finds a duplicate and stops:

```js
// Merging a repeat capture into the entry it belongs to is §06's job, and it needs the article
// conversation to do it well. Until then, say so plainly rather than making a near-duplicate.
```

**§06 REVISED — this is now buildable, and it needs no extra model call.** The resolve step already
returns `resolution.sentences`: the learner's own sentences, corrected and separated from anything a
dictionary supplied. So at the duplicate branch the server already knows whether the capture carried
anything the stored entry does not have. No pipeline change is required — the call it would need
has already happened.

                                         ▼
                          opens the stored article with the chat
                          seeded: "Fold this in: «…»" — one turn,
                          one proposal, reviewed and saved like
                          any other.
```

The capture response grows one field — `foldable: { sentences, reference }` or null — and the
duplicate panel in `AddView` grows one button. Two model calls total, exactly as composing a new
entry costs. `§05`'s decision — *a repeat capture is an addition, not an entry* — is implemented
without a merge path, a second writer, or anything the chat did not already do.

### §8.4 · A proposal under review, before it is saved

The same dock on `AddView`'s Article tab. The draft carries the ids `draftFrom` minted, so the
operations address it exactly as they address a stored one; the ops are applied to the draft, the
YAML is regenerated, and the tab re-derives as it already does on every keystroke. This makes
`§05`'s "regenerate with a note" obsolete in the good direction: instead of re-running generation
with a nudge and losing what was right, one sentence changes one thing.

**Deliberately last** in the build order (`§11`). It is the least valuable of the four and the one
most likely to want a different diff treatment, since everything in a fresh proposal is new.

---

## §9 · Protocol

`POST /api/acervo/v1/chat` — authenticated, owner-scoped, online-only, **writes nothing**.

```ts
export interface ChatTurn { role: "you" | "acervo"; text: string }

export interface ChatRequest {

- Timeout `CAPTURE_TIMEOUT` (120 s) — one model call, but a slow one, and the sync timeout would
  abort a request that is working. Same reasoning that already applies to capture.
- Limits, enforced server-side and stated in the prompt: `document` ≤ 32 KB, `reference` ≤ 8 KB
  (`REFERENCE_LIMIT`, already defined), `turns` ≤ 8 after truncation, `neighbours` ≤ 20, `ops` ≤ 12,
  `reply` ≤ 1200 characters, `followUps` ≤ 3 × 40 characters.
- Errors reuse the existing codes exactly: `capture_unavailable` when no model is configured,
  `llm_unreachable`, `llm_failed`, `llm_empty`, `llm_unusable`. Every message ends in *"so nothing
  was changed"*, matching the capture route's *"so nothing was created"*.
- Model: **SUPERSEDED** — neither `ACERVO_CHAT_MODEL` nor `ACERVO_LLM_MODEL` exists, and adding one
  would cut against the design: model choice is `models/catalogue.json` plus the owner's chain, and
  `deploy/acervo/install.sh` validates every environment name against the catalogue. Chat is a text
  call and answers on the owner's **text** chain — `chain_for(settings, owner, "text")`, resolved per
  request, so Settings ▸ Models takes effect on the next turn with nothing restarted. If chat later
  proves to want a different model, the shape is a fourth `kind` beside text/image/audio, and that
  should be justified by a measurement rather than assumed.
- Rate: **SUPERSEDED** — there is no rate-limiting machinery anywhere in the server, and building it
  means a store, which only `repository/` may own. Shipped without one: the route is authenticated
  and owner-scoped, one model call per turn, and a provider's own limit already surfaces as
  `llm_rate_limited` with `models/cooldown.py` resting the row. If a floor is wanted it belongs
  beside `model_selection` as an unreplicated table, not in the route.

### Prompts

Two new tracked files in `prompts/`, copied into the image and read at request time like the
existing pair. They are content, not code — changing what the chat says must not mean changing the
hook.

- `prompts/acervo_chat.md` — the article conversation: the hierarchy (`§4`), the operation
  language (`§5.1`), the provenance rules (`§5.2`), and "small, or nothing" (`§5.3`).
- `prompts/acervo_chat_reference.md` — the external-entry conversation: read-only throughout, no
  operation language at all, and the one action it may offer is a capture.

Two files rather than one with a mode switch: they are genuinely different jobs with different
output shapes, and the shorter one shares none of the longer one's edit language.

## §10 · Where the line falls

Chat is a **consumer of the core**, exactly as `§06` and `§01` place it. Concretely, it does not get:

- **Storage.** No collection, no `sync_state` entry, no tombstones, nothing replicated. The
  transcript is in memory and is lost on reload, on purpose.
- **A second writer.** Every change goes through `repository.saveArticle`, online, at the record's
  revision, refused if stale.
- **A second article format.** Operations are a wire format for one request. They are applied to an
  `ArticleDraft` and then they cease to exist.
- **A second serialiser.** `yaml.ts` remains the only place the projection is understood.
- **Agency.** Nothing is applied without a press, nothing is written without a second press, and
  every write is undoable with a third.
- **The whole vocabulary.** *"Which of my words are like this one"* across the entire store is a
  different feature with a different shape, and `§05` already argues why the interesting version of
  it — set difference against what you actually hold — is worth waiting for. Chat sends at most
  twenty neighbours and says so.
- **Offline anything.** A turn is a server round trip; reading the article never is. The dock is the
  only part of the article view that ever reports the server being down.

## §11 · Build order

All five stages are built, and a second round on the review surface followed real use on macOS, iOS
and Android. Its decisions are folded into the sections above and marked **REVISED in round two**:
no mark moves body text, a word-level diff, only the changed field tinted, `moved` as its own mark,
one uniform operation vocabulary, the focus chip on its own row, a review bar that never wraps, and
the largest detent at every width.

Two things only a live run against a real model could have told us in the first round, both now
closed:

- **`fromAttestation` arrives in two shapes.** A real model puts it inside `example` about half the
  time. Missing it is *silent*: the applier derives `origin: "llm"` for a sentence the learner
  actually met, and nothing downstream ever notices the entry has lied about where it came from.
  `services/chat.py` lifts it from either place, and the prompt says which one is right and why it
  matters.
- **A question was answered with a proposal.** "What is the difference between X and Y?" came back
  with an edit to the notes — over-eager, and what `§5.3` exists to prevent. The prompt says in as
  many words that a question gets prose and a `followUp`, and that proposing needs a request.

**The second round revised that contract.** Three prompt revisions later, a comparison question
still reliably came back with an offer to add the contrast to the notes. The honest conclusion was
that "never volunteer" is the wrong thing to assert: a proposal is **offered**, not applied — nothing
is written without a press on *Review* and a second on *Save* — so an unasked-for proposal is a
pre-computed follow-up. The contract held is **never rewrite what is already there unasked**:
`test_it_answers_a_question_without_rewriting_anything` allows at most two operations, no invented
ids, and only additions to the notes that keep every line already there. The prompt still asks for
the stricter behaviour, because the guidance is right where the model is unreliable, and a
coin-flip assertion is worse than an honest one.

Strengthening that guidance first over-corrected: *"I heard this on the radio: «…»"* stopped being
proposed. The prompt now carries an explicit two-column gate — the turn on the left, `proposal` or
none on the right — with volunteered sentences marked **yes**, *because they went to the trouble of
typing it*. And acknowledgements are banned as follow-ups: *"Looks good"* spent the one one-tap slot a
phone has on nothing. The prompt forbids them and `_shaped` drops one whose whole string, casefolded
and stripped of punctuation, is in a fixed set — whole-string only, so *"Thanks, now add an example"*
survives.

Each stage was useful on its own and shipped on its own.

1. **Explain only.** The route, both prompts' first halves, the dock, the sheet with its three
   detents, the keyboard work in `§7.3`, `followUps`, the focus chip. Returns prose and nothing
   else — `proposal` is not read yet. No write risk at all, and it is already most of the value.
2. **Proposals.** `articleEdit.ts` (`applyOps` + `diffDrafts`), the proposal card, the diff marks,
   the review bar, save and undo. This is the substance.
3. **External articles.** The reference subject, the `capture` card, the seed into `AddView`.
4. **The fold-in.** `foldable` on the capture response, the second button on the duplicate panel,
   the seeded turn. Closes `§05`'s open comment.
5. **The Add view.** The dock over an unsaved proposal.

### Verification

```
npm --prefix web run test         # articleEdit.test.ts is the new one that matters:
                                  #  · ops applied in order; unknown id refuses the whole set
                                  #  · a `ref` resolves; the example gets origin "attestation"
                                  #  · an added example gets origin "llm" and the model id
                                  #  · no op may set language or id; >12 ops refused
                                  #  · a proposal touching over half the records refused
                                  #  · parseArticle(yamlForDraft(applyOps(…))) round-trips
                                  #  · diffDrafts marks added / changed / removed by id
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/server  # the chat route against a temporary database:
                                  #  · no key → capture_unavailable, nothing else attempted
                                  #  · transcript truncated to 8; document and reference capped
                                  #  · a reference subject never returns ops
                                  #  · a malformed answer → llm_unusable, "nothing was changed"
npm --prefix web run test         # App.test.tsx: dock renders on a stored article, a proposal
                                  # renders marks, Save calls the repository once, Undo saves back
```

Manual, on the devices this is for:

- iPhone, PWA, keyboard up: composer above the keyboard, last turn visible, the masthead never off
  screen, the article scrollable while a turn is pending.
- iPad portrait: the article keeps its full measure with the dock present — the check the side-pane
  decision in `§7.1` exists to pass.
- Server stopped: the article reads normally, the dock says the server is needed, nothing is lost.
- Sync the same entry from a second device mid-conversation, then save: refused, plainly, and the
  proposal is dropped.
- Save, then Undo: the removed example comes back with its original id.

## §12 · Still open

- **Which neighbours to send.** Topic-mates is the obvious rule and probably enough. Same-lemma and
  headword-similar entries are cheap to add off the replica; whether they help is a question for
  after stage 1.
- **Whether the reply should stream.** **SUPERSEDED** — it *can* now; FastAPI streams. It still does
  not, and the reasons moved: the answer is one JSON object whose most valuable field is last, so
  streaming it needs a streaming JSON parser to show anything; it would fork
  `provider.text(…, as_json=True)`'s complete-`TextResult` contract, and `chain.walk` cannot decide
  a 429 fall-through until enough has arrived to know it is not an error; and it would be the first
  route outside `api/errors.py`'s `{"data": …}` envelope, so the first client path that does not get
  `AcervoApiError` handling for free. A three-second wait under a quiet "thinking" line may well be
  fine. Measure before building anything.
- **Whether `followUps` should be model-written or fixed presets.** Model-written costs nothing and
  is more relevant; fixed presets are predictable and always sensible. Start with model-written and
  fall back if they turn out bland.
- **Approving what chat adds.** A generated example lands `approved: false`, as it should. Whether
  reviewing a proposal should also approve what it adds, or whether that stays a separate gesture,
  is a question about the approval flow rather than about chat.
- **Whether the review count should count fields or records.** A sense whose definition *and*
  glosses moved is one change today — right for accepting, arguable for stepping, since `‹ ›` then
  cannot reach the second field. Nobody has wanted it yet.
- **The note-pairing constants**, a similarity of 0.5 and a three-token floor, are argued in
  `articleEdit.ts` and tuned only against the fixtures, never against real edits.
- **The prototype paints the review state by position.** `reviewMark` marks the first example and the
  second sense because it is a picture of the design, not a diff; if the marks grow much more
  structure, that picture will start to lie.
