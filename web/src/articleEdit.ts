/* ── applying a proposal, and showing what it did ────────────────────────
   Design §06. A turn of conversation returns prose and, when it implies a change, a small set of
   operations addressed by record id. This module applies them to a draft and compares the two
   drafts; nothing else in the interface knows the operation language exists.

   Pure, like `selectors.ts` and `yaml.ts` beside it: no storage, no network, no DOM, no clock. The
   one thing it cannot compute — a new record id — is handed in, so the module stays testable and
   the minting stays where the rest of the minting is.

   **The change marks come from `diffDrafts`, not from the operations.** That is deliberate and it
   is what makes the wire format replaceable: if a future model is better at returning a whole
   article than a list of edits, this file's first half goes and the second half, the review surface
   and the save path are all untouched. It also means a hand-edit in the YAML tab could be marked by
   the same machinery if that ever proves useful.

   Operations are a wire format for one request. They are applied to an `ArticleDraft` and then they
   cease to exist: there is no second article format, and the one writer is still
   `repository.saveArticle(parseArticle(text))`. */
