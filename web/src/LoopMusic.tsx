 * seed, which is the pair that replays it. A style — one of the generator's families, each with the
 * sentence the generator gives to choose it by. There is no "Auto" beside "Surprise me": they were
 * the same request under two names, and the list said both.

 * The styles are the generator's catalogue, read from `GET /loops/schema` once per session and never
