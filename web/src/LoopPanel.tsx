/**
 * Settings ▸ Loops: which voice speaks one, whether tracks are kept on this device, and what the
 * generator can do.
 *
 * Three kinds of thing, kept apart on the page as `PronunciationPanel` keeps its two apart. The
 * voice is **owner** state, stored beside the other two pronunciation uses and read by the server
 * when it renders — a phone that has never opened this screen gets the voice chosen here. Keeping a
 * track is a **device** fact — a laptop with room and a phone without want different answers, and it
 * never leaves the device. What the generator is and whether it has its sample pack is the
 * **deployment's**, read from the server and not settable here.
 *
 * Keeping is **off** by default, where keeping clips is on, and the difference is measured rather
 * than felt: a vocabulary's clips cost about what its text does, and one loop costs more than both.
 * With it off a loop still plays — the track is held for the session — it is simply not kept.
