/**
 * Where the line thinks the track is, which is not always where the element says it is.
 *
 * An element does not move the instant it is told to: it reports the old `currentTime` until a seek
 * lands, and near zero while a `src` is being replaced. The clock reads it every frame, so both of
 * those used to reach the screen — tapping a word lit the word *before* it for as long as the blob
 * took to come back out of IndexedDB, which is why the flicker was longer on a desktop than on a
 * phone. These pin the two halves of the answer: a move within a track already held is not a
 * reload, and a seek asked for outranks the element until the element agrees.
 *
 * `LoopPlayer.test.tsx` mocks `usePlayback` outright, so nothing there can see this.
