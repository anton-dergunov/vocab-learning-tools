/* ── the ask dock ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   One surface at every width: a bar pinned to the bottom of the article pane, which grows upward
   into a sheet. No side pane, ever (design `§06`, `§7.1`). The article column is 780 px and a tablet
   in portrait is about 834 px, so a docked side pane would cut the article to roughly 400 px to make
   room for a conversation that is usually two turns long. The dock costs the article nothing
   horizontally at any width, and on a phone it *is* the mobile design rather than a degraded
   version of a desktop one.

   The component is a launcher and a reading surface for prose, and deliberately not the place a
   proposal lives: **the answer to an editing turn is not a chat message, it is the article.** When a
   proposal is accepted the dock hands it up and collapses, and `App` puts the article into review.

   It knows nothing about the graph, the replica or the projection. `ask()` is handed down already
   knowing how to assemble a request, so the document is re-serialised on every turn and the model
   sees the saved article after a save rather than the one it was asked about. */
