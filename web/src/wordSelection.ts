/**
 * The selection: words put aside by hand to make something from — a loop or a story today.
 *
 * **This device's, and never synced.** It is a working pile rather than part of the vocabulary, so it
 * lives in local storage beside the other per-device state, not in the replicated graph, and it
 * touches no schema version. It survives changing topic, searching, opening an article or the map,
 * and reloading, which is the whole of what a selection has to do that a checkbox in one view could
 * not.
 *
 * **One selection per language, in the order the words were chosen**, because a loop and a story
 * are each in one language, and the first chosen are the ones a dialog uses when it cannot take them
 * all. The record carries the account it was made in: another account on this device reads an empty
 * selection and its first write replaces the record, the rule the replica already follows.
 *
 * An entry is a lexeme id and nothing else. What it is — its headword, whether it still exists — is
 * read from the replica when it is drawn (`selectedWords` in `selectors.ts`), so a word deleted
 * since simply stops appearing and nothing here ever needs repairing. Design:
 * `docs/plans/word-selection.md`.
