/**
 * The Models pane: which provider and model build an entry, in what order.
 *
 * The unit is a **(provider, model) pair**, not a provider. A free tier is metered per model, so
 * Gemini's two 500-a-day models are a thousand a day and the second is reached by the first one's
 * 429 — choosing between them is a real choice, not a detail.
 *
 * This is server state, not a device preference like the dictionary switches next door: it decides
 * what the vocabulary is made of, so an entry captured on a phone should be built by the same model
 * as one captured on a laptop. Saving is an ordinary online-only write that fails loudly.
 *
 * A pair whose provider this server has no credential for stays in the list, keeps its place and is
 * simply skipped when the chain is walked. That is deliberate: a chain is a preference and a
 * credential is a deployment fact, and a rotated key must not destroy an order or lock the owner
 * out of changing it.
