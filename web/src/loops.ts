/**
 * Playing a loop: the one place a track is heard, and the only audio element besides the one
 * `pronunciation.ts` owns.
 *
 * **The whole track is held in memory before a note of it plays.** The media route is behind bearer
 * auth, so its URL cannot go in an `<audio src>` — the same reason a picture is fetched as a blob —
 * and the constraint is the better design anyway: nothing touches the network during playback, which
 * is what a locked screen, a lift and a train need.
 *
 * **Keeping a track on the device is off by default**, unlike clips. A vocabulary's clips cost about
 * what its text does; one loop costs more than both. With it off a track is still held for the
 * session — pressing play twice does not download twice — it is simply not kept for tomorrow. The
 * cache is keyed on `audioRef`, which carries a digest of the bytes, so a re-render is a new
 * reference and a device holding the old one simply misses. There is no invalidation here and there
 * must not be.
 *
 * **One sound at a time.** This module stops `pronunciation.ts` and pauses every other registered
 * player before it plays, and registers its own pause with it, so a word read aloud, or a story,
 * silences the loop. The dependency runs one way: this imports that, and nothing imports this back.
 *
 * Which word is being taught, which of its two lines was last spoken and whether the answer has been
 * given are all `selectors.ts`'s, derived from the clock every frame. Nothing about the reveal is
 * decided here, and nothing about it is remembered — which is what makes dragging backwards put an
 * answer away again.
