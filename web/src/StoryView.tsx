/**
 * The Stories surface: the stories you have, and the one you are reading.
 *
 * Modelled on `LoopView.tsx` down to the row (`SwipeRow`), because it is the same shape of thing:
 * a list of made objects, each of which can be open, still being made, or asked for and never made.
 *
 * **One back arrow, and its meaning follows the level**: on an open story it returns to the
 * stories, and on the stories it returns to your words. Present at every width for the reason the
 * loops one is — a surface that replaces the list has to carry the way back out of itself.
 *
 * A story's state is derived and there is no status column: having no parts is the whole of what
 * "not written yet" means, and the job says how far along it is. So a story whose writing failed
 * simply reads as one that was asked for and not written, and Try again queues another.
