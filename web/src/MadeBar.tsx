/**
 * The ways in to what Acervo *made* from your words, and what is playing — in two shapes, because
 * the two widths want different things.
 *
 * Was `LoopBar.tsx`, and renamed when Stories arrived: it carries both now, and a file called
 * LoopBar that also owns the way in to stories would be a name that lies.
 *
 * **On a phone it is a bar at the foot of the window**, split in two — Loops and Stories — which is
 * where these belong on a device held in one hand. It is drawn over the list and nowhere else: the
 * article column already carries the view segments, the delete control, the progress strip and the
 * ask dock, and a second dock there is prohibited (design §2.13). There is deliberately no
 * mini-player over an article. The **+ is gone**: both surfaces carry their own Make button in
 * their own header, and a bar whose job is to be a way in should not also be a way to start
 * something.
 *
 * **On a desktop it is a chip in the top bar, and only while something is sounding.** The resting
 * button it used to draw has moved to the foot of the topic rail, beside Stories, because the top
 * bar was already carrying as much as it can and a third learning method would have made that
 * worse. So on a wide window this renders nothing at all until a loop plays.
 *
 * Both are the same component in two skins, so what they say can never disagree.
