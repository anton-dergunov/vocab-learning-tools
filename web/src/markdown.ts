/**
 * The Obsidian projection: a generated, read-only mirror of the vocabulary as markdown.
 *
 * A second projection alongside `yaml.ts`, and the same rule applies — this is the only place
 * markdown is written. It is export-only by design (`docs/features/export.md`): reconciling free-form markdown against a
 * structured store is the coupling this application exists to escape, so nothing reads it back.
 *
 * The shape is the convention the vault already uses, because a generated file that does not look
 * like the hand-written ones beside it is a file nobody reads:
 *
 *     ##### **el parlante** 🔊
 *     *speaker; loudspeaker*
 *     > Nos estamos conectando al **parlante** por Bluetooth. - We're connecting to the **speaker** via Bluetooth.
 *
 * Three lines at most, and that is the point. This file is scanned, not studied: a word, its
 * one-line gloss, and — only if there is one worth keeping — a sentence. Every sense, the notes and
 * the generated examples are deliberately left out; they are what the article is for, and putting
 * them here would turn a page you can run your eye down into a second copy of the vocabulary.
 *
 * Pure: no storage, no network, no DOM.
