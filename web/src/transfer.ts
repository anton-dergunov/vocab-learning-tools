 *
 * A word file is exactly the document `yaml.ts` already writes, with its ids stripped. There is no
 * second format and no second parser: a bundle is read back through `parseArticle` and written
 * through `repository.saveArticle`, which is the one write path with the diffing, validation and
 * atomicity every other caller gets.
 *
 * Export is built from the replica alone, so it works with the server unreachable, like every other
 * read. Import is a sequence of ordinary writes, so it is online-only and fails loudly, like every
 * other write.

 * The only compatibility step in Acervo, and a deliberate exception to the rule against them.
 *
 * Everywhere else the current model simply replaces the old one, because there is nothing to
 * protect. A bundle is different: it is a file that has left the application and outlived the
 * schema it was written under, which is the entire reason it exists. So an easy adaptation — a
 * renamed field, a new one with a sensible default, an enum value that maps cleanly — belongs here,
 * in one function, rewriting the text before `parseArticle` ever sees it. Anything that is not easy
 * is refused and converted outside the application, and this function must never grow into a second
 * pipeline.
 *
 * Version 6 is readable as it stands. Version 7 added optional keys to a picture — the example it
 * anchors on, and the state the server keeps about drawing it — and a version 6 word file simply
 * does not carry them, which `readPrompt` already reads as "none" and "nothing attempted". Version
 * 8 added optional keys to an example — a clip's channel, its end, and the corpus segment it names
 * — and neither an older word file carries them, which `readExample` already reads as absent.
 * Nothing was renamed and nothing was removed in either step, so there is no text to rewrite: these
 * are versions being *accepted*, which is the cheapest form the exception takes and the one to
 * prefer.
 *
 * Version 9 added an optional `emoji` to a sense, which an older file simply lacks, and removed an
 * example's `approved`, which every older file carries and the reader now refuses as unknown. That
 * is the one rewrite here: the line is dropped from each word file. It carried no information —
 * nothing ever set it true — so there is nothing to carry forward.
 *
 * Version 10 added an optional `emotion` to an example, which an older file simply lacks, and removed
 * an example's `audioRef`, a pasted reference nothing ever generated. That line is dropped the way
 * `approved` is; a clip is its own record now, carried under `audio/` rather than in the word file.
 *
 * `clipsSearchedAt` is deliberately not in the format at all. It is state the server keeps, like a
 * picture's attempt counter, so an imported word arrives never-consulted and its enrichment finds it —
 * which is the right answer for a word that has just changed accounts.
 *
 * Note what is not here. A version 6 bundle carries no example ids, so a picture in one cannot name
 * the sentence it illustrates and does not get an anchor invented for it — matching by position or
 * by text would be a guess, and a wrong anchor puts the picture under the wrong sentence.
