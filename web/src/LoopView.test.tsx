/**
 * The loops list, and the two ways out of it.
 *
 * A pointer right-clicks a row; a finger pushes it aside and finds Delete behind it, which is CSS
 * and therefore invisible to jsdom — so what is pinned here is that the button exists on every row
 * and that both routes call the same thing. The row a loop was never made for matters most: that is
 * the one you most want rid of, and while it was a `disabled` button it answered no gesture at all.
