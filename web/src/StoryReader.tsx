/**
 * Reading a story: a deck of pages, one part to a page, and a last page that lists the words.
 *
 * **A deck rather than a scroller**, and that is the whole layout decision. A part is two to four
 * sentences under a picture, which is about one screen — so a column of them is a page you scroll to
 * see what a swipe would show whole. It is the same deck a word's cards are (`deck.tsx`), and so it
 * moves the same way: a swipe that follows the finger, a horizontal scroll, the arrow keys, and two
 * arrows that sit beside the column when there is margin for them and under it when there is not.
 * There are no dots and no footer — where you are is the counter in the header, and a control that
 * needs its own row is a row the story does not get. The ivy leaves are for the wide layout only,
 * where they fill the space the picture leaves the words; narrow, the picture opens the page.
 *
 * **The translation is never drawn before it is asked for**, which is `LoopPlayer`'s rule about an
 * answer arriving before the recall gap has passed, in the one other place Acervo has one. The
 * space it will take is held open, so revealing it does not move the story under the reader's eye.
 *
 * Marks are found rather than stored: `storySpans` locates the forms the writer reported, and a
 * form it cannot find is simply not marked. The translation is marked the same way from the words
 * the translator reported, and a story translated before that was asked for simply has none.
 * See `selectors.ts`.
 *
 * **A part can be read aloud**, by the button beside its heading. Pressing it while it plays pauses it
 * and pressing it again carries on; there is no scrubber, because swiping to another part and back is
 * the way to begin again — a page that stops being the one on screen stops its audio and forgets the
 * position. A part read by a directed voice also knows where its passages are, and each is then a
 * place to start: touched while nothing plays it plays that passage alone, touched while it plays it
 * moves there. The passage that is sounding is tinted, and **nothing about it moves the text** — the
 * tint is a background, never padding, weight or size. See `storyAudio.ts`.
 *
 * Only a page and its neighbours fetch their picture. Every page is mounted — that is what lets a
 * swipe show the next one under the finger — but a picture is a blob behind bearer auth, and a
 * story of six should not ask for six at once to read the first.
