"""Layer 2: a model reads two articles for the same word and says which is better.

Blind and **position-swapped**. Each pair is asked twice, once each way round, because a judge that
prefers whichever article it saw first is measuring the ordering rather than the articles. Where the
two orderings disagree the pair counts as *no difference*, and the flip rate is reported: it is this
instrument's own noise, and a high one invalidates the layer.

The judge is a Pro model and **not one of the arms**. Grading a model's own output is the strong
documented self-preference case, and one of the arm pairs is Vertex Flash. Family preference may
remain — every comparison is within one arm-model, both sides from the same one, so it largely
cancels — and `--judge` exists so a second family can check that.

A **cost pilot** runs first: ten calls, the real per-call cost printed, before the other three
hundred and fifty. A preview model's published rate is an assumption; `costUsd` is not.

SYSTEM = """You compare two vocabulary articles written for the same word, for a learner who already
speaks the gloss language and is learning the word's language.

Judge only what is there to read. Which article would teach this word better?

Weigh, roughly in this order:
- whether the meanings that matter are covered, and whether a meaning is missing or invented
- whether the usage notes say something a dictionary would not, or are filler
- whether the examples are natural sentences a person would say, and earn their place
- whether the glosses and the definition are accurate and well chosen

Ignore: formatting, key order, field presence for its own sake, and length as such. A shorter article
that teaches better is better.

Answer with one JSON object and nothing else:

{"winner": "A" | "B" | "same",
 "magnitude": 1 | 2 | 3,
 "decidedBy": "senses" | "notes" | "examples" | "glosses" | "definitions",
 "reason": "one sentence, at most 25 words"}

`same` is a real answer and often the right one; use magnitude 1 for a slight difference, 3 for a
clear one, and 1 with `same` when they are equivalent."""
