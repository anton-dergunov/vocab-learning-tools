"""Which encoding should a stored pronunciation be in? A blind listening test.

Two commands:

    python experiments/pronunciation-encoding/run.py make     # synthesise, encode, shuffle, write the sheet
    python experiments/pronunciation-encoding/run.py reveal   # only once the sheet is filled in

**One master per piece, encoded every way.** The first attempt asked the API for the same sentence in
each encoding and compared those, and that was wrong: a Gemini voice *re-performs* the line on every
call — the same request came back 16,992 bytes one minute and 22,176 the next — so the candidates
differed by performance as much as by codec. So each piece is synthesised **once**, uncompressed, and
every candidate is that one master encoded locally. Google's own files are still fetched and measured,
to show that its bitrates are what the local encodes are set to.

**Blind by construction.** Every candidate is decoded back to a plain 24 kHz WAV under a shuffled id,
so a file extension cannot name the codec while the artifacts — the thing being judged — survive
decoding untouched, which is what a player does anyway before the sound reaches an ear.

The API is called directly rather than through `acervo.models`, deliberately: this test needs
encodings and sample rates the catalogue does not declare, and an experiment that had to change the
shipped row in order to measure it would be measuring the change. `experiments/` may not be imported
by anything that ships (`tests/unit/server/test_layering.py`), and this keeps that trivially true.

Nothing here is a second pipeline: the outcome is one value in `models/catalogue.json`.
