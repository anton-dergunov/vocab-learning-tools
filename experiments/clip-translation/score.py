"""How much of a passage a translation actually carries, computed rather than judged.

Two metrics that check each other.

**Anchor coverage** is hand-written but disciplined: the source is partitioned into clauses whose
texts concatenate back to it exactly, each clause carries one disjunction of acceptable renderings,
and coverage is weighted by how many characters of the source each clause is. That is what separates
"dropped the whole first sentence" (≈0.45) from "skipped one adjective" (≈0.96); a plain
fraction-of-anchors-found scores both near 0.67 and is useless for the failure this experiment
exists to measure.

Each clause is matched to **its own occurrence**: a clause may take any position in the translation,
but no two clauses may take the same one. That is a maximum-weight bipartite matching, and both
halves of it are load-bearing. Without the one-occurrence-each rule, *picaba mucho, picaba mucho* is
two clauses that one "itched a lot" would satisfy twice, and a dropped repetition would score full.
With an order rule instead, every clause a target language legitimately reorders starves the next
one — English puts *posh* before *castle* and Chinese puts the relative clause before its head, and
an in-order walk scored both of those as missing.

**Relative length** is the anchor-free cross-check, and it is what makes this fair across scripts: a
row's length ratio over the median ratio of *complete* rows in the same target language. A faithful
translation sits near 1.0 whether it is English or Japanese; one that dropped half its source sits
near 0.5 in both. Nothing here hard-codes a per-language constant.

Scoring never spends a model call, so correcting an anchor set and re-scoring a whole run is free.
