"""Apply the measured `primaryGloss`/`emotion` fix to the owner's REAL, already-captured words.

This is the one script in this experiment that writes to the live server. Everything else here
(`run.py`, `score.py`) only ever calls a model and reads what comes back. This one calls
`POST /graph` — the same route, same validation, same revision allocation a phone gets
(`src/acervo/client.py`) — because `compose` never re-runs on an existing lexeme: shipping the fixed
prompt only helps words captured *after* it ships, and nothing else touches `primaryGloss`/`emotion`
on a record that already has them. This script is that "something else," run once, by hand.

**Nothing is written by default.** Every run without `--apply` only pulls, classifies and prints what
it *would* change — the two costly, hard-to-undo mistakes here are asking the model for nothing
(wasted calls) and writing something wrong to 1,000+ real records, and the second is the one this
guards against.

**Narrow repair stays narrow.** A lexeme selected because its `primaryGloss` is wrong is asked ONLY
to redo `primaryGloss`; a lexeme selected because its `emotion` is empty is asked ONLY to redo
`emotion`. Neither call touches the other field, and neither touches senses, notes, examples or
anything else on the record — the full pulled record is sent back on write with only the one field
changed, because the graph's write contract has no partial patch: an incoming lexeme change replaces
every column (`domain/projection.py::_assign_lexeme`), so anything not resent is wiped.

**Every proposed value is checked before it is written**, not just generated: a `primaryGloss` that
still collapses a multi-word headword to one word, or an `emotion` that isn't `null` and isn't 3-12
plain words, is logged and left alone rather than written — the old (bad) value survives to be looked
at by hand, which is better than a second bad value nobody chose.

**The field rules are read from the shipped prompt at call time**, not copied here, so this script
cannot drift from what `prompts/acervo_compose.md` actually says.

Run from anywhere with network access to the server — this is an ordinary HTTPS client, exactly what
the app itself is. No NAS, no Docker, no SSH.
